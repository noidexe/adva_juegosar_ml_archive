No existen\nlas divisiones en la pol=EDtica, =\r\nen la vida, est=E1 todo entrelazado.\n\n(*) De un ex marine: \n\n&quot;&quot;&quot;\nAll the ta=\r\nlk in the media about the treatment of Iraqi prisoners and the rape\nof Iraq=\r\ni women has me remembering my days in the U.S. Marine Corps.\n\nA couple thin=\r\ngs in particular struck me. Number one, the idea that the\nU.S. military is =\r\na &quot;value-based organization&quot;. And the second thing being that\nthe people wh=\r\no did what has been reported and photographed to the Iraqi\nprisoners were o=\r\nnly a small deviant minority and in no way are representative\nof the majori=\r\nty of the military.\n\nBack during my first year in the USMC, one thing stuck=\r\n out in my mind that\nrelates directly to the above topics. In all of our tr=\r\naining, be it Boot Camp,\nInfantry School, or on-going regular unit training=\r\n, we were taught two things\nin particular. Number one, we were taught to be=\r\n extremely aggressive on\ncommand. The level of aggression taught is unprece=\r\ndented in &quot;civil&quot; society\nwhere only the most violent criminals display the=\r\n level expected from\nU.S. Marines. And second, we were taught to be smart w=\r\nhile we were being\naggressive. This latter teaching involved overcoming our=\r\n own normal fears and\ninstinctive reactions so that we could more efficient=\r\nly channel our aggresion\ntowards killing the enemy while sustaining minimal=\r\n casualties ourselves. These\ntwo things combined make a truly deadly combin=\r\nation, even without &quot;modern&quot;\nweapons.\n\nSometime during our initial training=\r\n, we were schooled in how to behave\ngenerally. We were told morals. We were=\r\n told how to be &quot;honorable&quot; and\n&quot;just&quot;. But what stuck out was that I could=\r\n see that what we were being told\nabout these things did not fit well at al=\r\nl with the aggression and the killing\nsmarts that we were being taught else=\r\nwhere in our training. And probably you\ncan guess where the emphasis lay. O=\r\nn one hand we should be deadly and savage\nkilling machines, and on the othe=\r\nr hand we should be polite, honorable, and\nreserved. Clearly these two worl=\r\nds do not match. And the one that was tied to\nsurvival and &quot;winning&quot; would =\r\nsurely be the one that would &quot;win out&quot; over the\nother.\n\nThis was particular=\r\nly clear to me when I spent about a year on a USMC base in\nOkinawa, Japan. =\r\nYou&#39;ve probably all heard about the problems they&#39;ve had with\nrapes and ass=\r\naults on Japanese Nationals in Okinawa from U.S. servicemen. I\nwatched myse=\r\nlf and the other men in my unit as we trained hard on how to best\nkill the =\r\nenemy, and then in the evenings we went out into town and were\nexpected to =\r\nbehave like civil gentleman and treat others as human beings. Often\nI was s=\r\nhocked at the irony of the situation. The ONLY thing that deterred us\nfrom =\r\nbeing MORE aggressive in town was the fact that the Japanese Police were\nas=\r\n tough as we were and they had weapons and were allowed by law to use any\na=\r\nmount of force they wanted to.\n\nIn Boot Camp, we were subjected to a great =\r\nmany humiliating experiences,\nincluding doing things in the nude. These thi=\r\nngs were a part of the\nbrainwashing techniques applied to the recruits and =\r\nalso included things like\nsleep deprivation and severe stress. Please note,=\r\n THESE THINGS WERE DONE TO\nRECRUITS! It is only natural that some of us wou=\r\nld go on to use some of those\nsame techniques on others, including on other=\r\n Marines. To say that members of\nthe military who do these things to others=\r\n only represents a small number of\ndeviants is hogwash. We were all TAUGHT =\r\nthese things by having them done to us!\n\nAnd not only were we taught to do =\r\nthese kinds of things, in many cases we were\nencouraged, sometimes even by =\r\ntradition. For instance, when an enlisted man\ngained rank, all other enlist=\r\ned men of the same rank or higher in the unit were\nexpected to abuse the ne=\r\nwly promoted man in a certain way. For E-3 and E-2, we\nwere to be punched i=\r\nn each shoulder. I became a Lance Corporal (E-3) while in\nOkinawa in a unit=\r\n of about forty enlisted men with all but about a half dozen\nof them E- 3 o=\r\nr above. More than thirty Marines literally lined up in a double\nrow while =\r\nI walked down the middle and stood still while two of them punched me\nin th=\r\ne shoulder at the same time, one on each side. I have pictures of the\nbruis=\r\nes that literally wrapped around the top of my arms 360 degrees! And most\nm=\r\nen considered these bruises marks of honor! I couldn&#39;t move my arms for a\nw=\r\neek. When a Marine was promoted to Corporal (E-4), then not only was the\nsh=\r\noulder punched, but the sides of the knees were kicked, too. It was normal\n=\r\nfor many newly promoted corporals to spend a week or two in the hospital ri=\r\nght\nafter being promoted. When I gained the rank of Corporal three months b=\r\nefore\nleaving the USMC, I was willing to fight to keep from getting hit or =\r\nkicked and\nso they mostly left me alone.\n\nTo further demonstrate the point,=\r\n I would like to relate something graphic that\nwas a weekly ritual for awhi=\r\nle in my last unit. Every week we went to the\narmory and checked out our we=\r\napons and cleaned them. During my first several\nmonths in this particular u=\r\nnit, there was a group of Marines in the unit who\nhad been with each other =\r\nfor quite some time. I was a part of an influx of\nnewer members to the unit=\r\n and most all of us &quot;newbies&quot; were of less rank than\nthe other guys and we =\r\nhad not formed a close bond with anyone else like the\n&quot;older&quot; ones had with=\r\n each other. We would all take our weapons outside into a\nfenced-in area ar=\r\nound the armory and disassemble them on wooden tables and\nclean them for an=\r\n hour or more. During this time, the &quot;older&quot; guys decided it\nwould be fun t=\r\no humiliate the &quot;newbies&quot;. Two of them would sneak up to one of\nus and hold=\r\n the person bent over and prone across the table. A third Marine\nwould run =\r\nup and pretend to have sex with the held down Marine. After\nwitnessing this=\r\n behavior, I was mortified, to say the least. I did NOT want it\nto happen t=\r\no me for obvious reasons. But there wasn&#39;t much we could do about\nit. Our l=\r\neaders didn&#39;t care and considered it just &quot;play&quot; among the troops. I\nmanage=\r\nd to avoid being targeted because I pretended to the perpetrators that I\nmi=\r\nght actually enjoy it and for some reason that bothered them so they avoide=\r\nd\nme.\n\nTo make a long story longer, what I have said above is only the tip =\r\nof the ice\nberg. I could go on for pages and pages and I was only a Marine =\r\nfor four\nyears. Now consider that these were things that we did to EACH OTH=\r\nER! And on a\nregular, EVERYDAY basis! These were not &quot;isolated incidents&quot; a=\r\nmong a few\ndeviants. These are the &quot;values&quot; that we put into practice on an=\r\n\norganization-wide scale. This is the &quot;inside story&quot; behind all the flag wa=\r\nving\nand heroic tales of courage and valor. This is the real military man b=\r\nehind the\nred, white, and blue embroidered curtain. THESE are the people wh=\r\no are now\nhanding out &quot;freedom&quot; and &quot;liberation&quot; and &quot;democracy&quot;.\n\nNow taki=\r\nng this all into account, just imagine for a minute what would happen\nwith =\r\nservicemen who had almost absolute power over a group of prisoners, people\n=\r\nwho are &quot;foreigners&quot; and considered enemies. Remember, military members are=\r\n\ntaught to kill enemies which means that enemies must be faceless lumps of =\r\nflesh\nto be shot at, they are not real human beings. If the servicemen were=\r\n trained\nto abuse each other who they saw as &quot;brothers-in-arms&quot;, just imagi=\r\nne how they\nwould treat those who were seen as foreigners and enemies and w=\r\nho they had real\npower over. It is truly chilling to consider. And with all=\r\n the new reports, we\ndon&#39;t even have to imagine anymore.\n&quot;&quot;&quot;\n\n\nSaludos,\nNah=\r\nuel Greco.\n\n\n\n"}}
