This\nbook does something that other shader books don’t. It focuses solely on\nshaders and their creation. You’ll use ATI’s RenderMonkey platform,\ngiving you an easy-to-use framework for shader development and allowing\nyou to focus your energy on shader development rather than the\ndevelopment of framework applications. Cover simple techniques, from the\nbasics of color filters to more advanced topics, such as depth of field,\nheat shimmer, and high-dynamic range rendering. Extensive excercises at\nthe end of each chapter allow you to test your skills by expanding upon\nthe shader you’ve just developed. Whether you are an engineer or a\ntechnically minded artist, you’ve finally found the ideal guide for\nmastering shaders!\n\n\n\n\n\n\t &lt;http://www.courseptr.com/images/covers/1-59200-205-6_cover_r.jpg&gt;\n\n\tBeginning C++ Game Programming\n&lt;http://www.courseptr.com/ptr_detail.cfm?group=Game%20Development&subcat=Programming%20Techniques&isbn=1%2D59200%2D205%2D6&gt;\n\n\tISBN: 1-59200-205-6\n\t$29.99 List Price\n\t$20.99 Your Price\n\n\n\n\tInteractivity—the unique feature that sets games apart from other forms\nof entertainment. The power of interactivity lies in the programming that\noccurs behind the scenes. If you’re ready to jump into the world of\nprogramming for games, Beginning C++Game Programming will get you started\non your journey, providing you with a solid foundation in the game\nprogramming language of the professionals. As you cover each programming\nconcept, you’ll create small games that demonstrate your new skills.\nWrap things up by combining each major concept to create an ambitious\nmultiple player game.

As a game\ndeveloper, you know that math is a fundamental part of your programming\narsenal. In order to program a game that goes beyond the basics, you must\nfirst master concepts such as matrices and vectors. In this book, you\nwill find some unique solutions for dealing with real problems you’ll\nface when programming many types of 3D games. Not only will you learn how\nto solve these problems, you’ll also learn why the solution works,\nenabling you to apply that solution to other problems. You’ll also\nlearn how to leverage software to help solve algebraic equations. Through\nnumerous examples, this book clarifies how mathematical ideas fit\ntogether and how they apply to game programming.\n\n\n\n\n\n\t &lt;http://www.courseptr.com/images/covers/1-59200-117-3_cover_r.jpg&gt;\n\n\tInspired 3D Short Film Production\n&lt;http://www.courseptr.com/ptr_detail.cfm?group=Graphic%20Design&isbn=1%2D59200%2D117%2D3&gt;\n\n\tISBN: 1-59200-117-3\n\t$59.99 List Price\n\t$41.99 Your Price\n\n\n\n\tNo other storytelling medium offers as flexible a stage as that of\nanimation.
