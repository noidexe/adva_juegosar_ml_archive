The closing comes in response \nto a transaction that occur=\r\nred on Sunday, in which a client obtained \n$3,000 worth of online currency =\r\nfor nothing. \n\nAccording to GOM President Jamie Hale, the perpetrator purch=\r\nased \n$3,000 worth of Star Wars Galaxies and EVE Online credits. \nImmediate=\r\nly after he received the currencies in-game, he retracted \nthe PayPal payme=\r\nnt, claiming that the goods were never delivered. \nHale suspects that incid=\r\nent is part of a larger case of identity \ntheft. \n\nGOM allows players of ma=\r\nssively multiplayer online games to exchange \nin-game currencies for real-l=\r\nife dollars. The company holds the game \ncurrencies for sellers, and after =\r\nreceiving payment via PayPal, \ndelivers the purchased currencies to the buy=\r\ners through in-game \navatars. The incident takes advantage of a PayPal poli=\r\ncy in which \nsellers of &quot;intangible goods,&quot; such as a subscriptions or comp=\r\nuter \nsoftware, receive no protection because there is no widely accepted \n=\r\nproof-of-shipment methods for these goods. \n\nGOM has provided detailed info=\r\nrmation to the PayPal fraud department, \nyet the company does not hold much=\r\n hope. In the letter, cofounders \nHale and Tom Merrall expressed their &quot;gre=\r\nat frustration and anger&quot; \nover the event, saying that &quot;PayPal&#39;s dated poli=\r\ncy on the sale \nof `intangible goods&#39; is well-known, and yet they refuse to=\r\n accept \nany responsibility for the fraud that this policy actually \nencour=\r\nages.&quot; \n\nThey have also filed a complaint with the FBI Internet Fraud \nDepa=\r\nrtment about both the incident and PayPal&#39;s policy. But Hale said \ntoday th=\r\nat he does &quot;not expect to hear back from them for months, if \nnot years.&quot; \n=\r\n\nWhat will it take to bring the other games back to the GOM exchange? \nHale=\r\n says that both PayPal and the online game publishers will have \nto rethink=\r\n their policies. &quot;The game companies need to recognize in-\ngame commodifica=\r\ntion is going to happen,&quot; said Hale. &quot;They have to \nagree to work with us, =\r\nand work with PayPal.&quot; Until that happens, \nhowever, several hundred GOM us=\r\ners will have to take their business \nelsewhere. \n\nGOM previously supported=\r\n currency exchanges in Second Life, Star Wars \nGalaxies, There, Horizons, E=\r\nVE Online, Project Entropia, and \nRuneScape. The company is based in Markha=\r\nm, Ontario, Canada. \n\n\nSaludos, Pato.\n\nPD: Por lo que se, lo de la pistolit=\r\na es como menciona Juan L. \nleyendo la intensidad en un punto de la pantall=\r\na.\nPensar que hace muchisimos a=F1os habia un jueguito (mecanico) que \nfunc=\r\nionaba al reves, el rev=F3lver tenia una lamparita y una lechuza \ncon un se=\r\nnsor en en el centor, minimizabas la luz del ambiente y si \nhacias centro s=\r\ne encendian los ojos de la lechui haciendo CU CU CU.\nSi alguien lo vi=F3 sa=\r\nbe de que hablo....
