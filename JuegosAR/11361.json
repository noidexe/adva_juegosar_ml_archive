La primer parte es la pregunta original. Las \nsiguientes son las respuestas.\n\nPido disculpas para los que no entiendan el idioma, pero no tengo tiempo \ncomo para traducirlo.\n\nLa informacion de contacto de los que escriben las elimine por razones \neticas de la lista.\n\n\n\n-------- Original Message --------\n\nHello everybody.\n\nWell, I&#39;ve decided that at this point in time I really want to try \nto get into the industry and put off gradschool for a little bit \nafter graduating from university, so I&#39;m starting my future job \nsearch.  This means working on the oh-so-wonderful resumes (I say \nresumes because I am working on a general as well as a few \nspecialized resumes), and I have some questions pertaining to a game-\ndevelopment related resume.\n\nOne of my main questions relates to the fact that in the realm of \ngame development-related concepts, I&#39;m mainly self-taught.  \nTherefore, I can&#39;t list under my formal education skills game-\nrelated stuff, like 2D/3D graphics, collision detection, simple game \nAI, level loading, game data management, etc.  However, can I put \nthese under my skills?  And should I point out the fact that I&#39;m \nself-taught?  I&#39;m not sure if that&#39;s would be good or bad.  On the \none hand, it shows I&#39;m motivated enough to learn on my own, on the \nother, it shows that I didn&#39;t recieve a formal education on these \nthings.\n\nAnother thing is, how important is a resume for an entry-level \nposition being one page?  I&#39;ve heard adages about resumes being an \nadvertisement, not a book, and that HR people only want to scan \nthem, not read them.  \n\nif the one page rule is cardinal, what type of jobs should I put on \na game-related resume?  Throughout my college career, I&#39;ve worked \nmany jobs, usually 2 or 3 at a time.  Each of them (aside from a few \nlike dishwasher and gas attendant) have some sort of relevance to \nthem.  For example, I was a nightshift manager at a gas station for \na year.  This shows I have experience coordinating people.  However, \nI don&#39;t think that&#39;s important for an entry level job.  I was also a \nteaching assistant, which shows that I have a strong familiarity \nwith operating systems.  Would this be a good thing to put on my \nresume?\n\nAlso, I have put a lot of my personal game projects on my website.  \nWould it be helpful to point this out in my resume and provide a \nlink to the games?  or would it make my resume look less \nprofessional?\n\nI come to you guys with these questions because I know that you guys \nare knowledgeable and usually willing to help.  I also know that \nthere may be a few others who have the same questions, but are \nafraid to ask, so any help that you give me might help them as well.\n\nok, thanks everyone, and I&#39;m eager to see what your responses are!\n\nLukas\n\n\n\n\n"}}
