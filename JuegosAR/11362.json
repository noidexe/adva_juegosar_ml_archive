When you are applying for a specific\nposition, make sure you put all the relevant qualifications you have that\nmatch the job description in the top quarter of the resume - that makes\nit as easy as possible for HR people to see that you match the job and\nwill put it in the &quot;keep for consideration&quot; pile.\n\nDefinitely mention self-taught education. It may actually be easier to\nput all your skills on your resume, and then mention in your cover letter\nwhat is self-taught and what is formal education. Also mention other\nvolunteer involvements with the industry, such as being a Conference\nAssociate at the GDC, any other clubs you belong to like IGDA or\nSIGGRAPH.\n\nI put together several documents for my job interviews: Cover Letter,\nResume, Work History, Education History, References. Also, because I have\ndone a lot of work through temporary agencies, I have a separate\nTemporary Work History to show specific companies I have worked for and\nthe assignments I did. For my first contact with a company I just use the\nCover Letter and Resume. At the bottom of the Resume and in the text of\nthe Cover Letter I indicate that I have a complete Work History,\nEducation History and References available upon request. When I actually\nget to filling out an application, I use the Work History, Education\nHistory and References - I have found that most of the time I am given\nthe application in the waiting room for the 15 minutes before the\ninterview. This is never enough time to complete the application, and not\nall the information is in my memory. And the application usually has\nimpossibly small spaces for the information. Often the application says,\n&quot;If you need additional space, attach to the application.&quot; So, it is much\neasier to have all that information already typed up and simply attach\nit.\n\nIn my Resume I only have my RELEVANT work experience, usually listed in\nthe order of greatest relevance towards the top (even if it is not my\nmost recent job). The Work History has all my jobs in reverse\nchronological order (most recent first all the way to my first job as a\nteenager). This makes the Resume easier to read and relate to the job I\nam applying for. I do a similar thing with my Education History, simply\nlisting relevant education on the Resume, then a detailed list on the\nseparate Education History (this is where I list my self-taught stuff as\nwell).\n\nIf possible, while you are researching the company, see if there are any\nresumes online for the people you plan to work with. Some company\nwebsites have links between the name of the employee and the person&#39;s\nresume/website. This can give you an idea of what they like to see in a\nresume based on what they put in their own resume and how they like to\nsee it.\n\nAnd like Amir said: Network, network, network. This is the single most\nsuccessful way that people get jobs, better than newspaper ads, job\nagencies, online job websites, etc. I also would recommend the book,\n&quot;What Color is Your Parachute&quot; for any job search.\n\nGood Luck!\n\nMahalo :-)\n------------------------------------------\nLincoln Anderson\n------------------------------------------\n\n\n\n\n"}}
