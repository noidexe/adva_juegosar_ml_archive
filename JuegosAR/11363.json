With determination, know that you\nwill get there.\n\nMy first recommendation is to pick up a copy of &quot;Get in the Game!&quot;, by Marc\nMencher.  Most of the suggestions I will be making come from this book.\nFollow this book closely and you&#39;ll be much better off.  When he says to\nbuild a contact database, don&#39;t say to yourself, &quot;Oh, that&#39;s a good idea,&quot;\nbut then never get around to doing it.  Actually do it!\n\nTo help focus your resum�, you should start out with a short cover letter\naimed specifically at the company where you are applying for a position.\nFirst, do a little research about the company and try to find out the name\nof the person you will be addressing this letter to.  \n\nStart out with an energetic statement about who you are and why you\n*specifically* like their company.  List the *specific* position you are\napplying for and list three of the qualifications that fit best for *this*\njob.  Use bullet points for your qualifications so they stand out from the\nrest of the letter.  That way, if an HR manager were scanning your cover\nletter, then they&#39;d see your qualifications immediately.  Close with a\nparagraph inviting them to look at your resum� and an enclosed CD-ROM of\nyour *best* work.  Leave a phone number and time that they can reach you.\nFinally, list a specific date or time period that you will contact them if\nyou have not heard from them beforehand.  If you need an example of a cover\nletter, e-mail me off the list and I&#39;ll send you a copy.\n\nI suggest keeping your resum� to one-page if you are entry-level, unless you\nwrote an optimized NVIDIA driver for Linux from scratch in your spare time.\n\n\nStart off the page with the usual contact information and immediately below\nlist the title *exactly* as it was listed on their website, want-ad, etc.\nIn regards to your question about being self-taught, you should definitely\nlist all your *applicable* skills for the position.  List these right at the\ntop of your resume in bullet form before you go into further detail.  Until\nrecently, it has been accepted in the industry that most of the skills\nneeded for game development are self-taught.  However, some schools are\nstarting to offer classes on topics such as AI, Game Design, Graphics, etc.\n\n\nIn a new section, list your experience in chronological form.  If your paid\njobs have nothing to do with game development or are a stretch, then don&#39;t\nlist them.  Instead list your game or programming projects that you\ncompleted in school.  Elaborate on the list of skills you mentioned at the\ntop of your resum�.\n\nThird, have a separate section for education listing the degree you received\nand any additional information that elicits your performance in college\n(e.g. graduating with high honors).  Also, you can list the relevant course\ntopics you took under this section.\n\nLastly, list one or two references, that you have *contacted* beforehand.\nGive them a call and ask them questions such as, &quot;What is one quality that I\nhave and one area that you think I could work on?&quot;  Hopefully, they will\ngive you an honest response.  This will help you gauge whether they would be\na good reference to list.\n\nThe most important part is to keep the attention of your reader focused.\nRemember that a resum�, if effective, gets you a phone call and not the job\nitself.  *You* are whats going to get the job after you talk with them on\nthe phone and they see how great a fit you would be to their team.\n\nTake the time to prepare a CD-ROM if you have good demos to show off and\nmake sure they are easy to run/install.  If you are going to submit most of\nyour applications electronically, then create a website where those demos\ncan be downloaded.\n\nInstead of sending out a resum� to anybody and everybody, narrow a list down\nto a small number of companies that you really want to work for.  This\nenthusiasm you have for their company will show naturally when corresponding\nwith HR.\n\nAnd as you probably already know: network, network, network.  Make sure all\nyour family, friends, friends of friends, friends of family know that you\n*are* a game developer.  One day your grandmother will be playing a card\ngame with her friends and she&#39;ll find out that someone&#39;s grandson works in\nthe video game industry.  Next thing you know, you&#39;ll be having lunch with\nthem and building a solid contact in the game industry.\n\nAnd by all means, keep working on small games in your free time to hone\nthose skills.\n\nBest of luck,\nAmir\n\n\n\n\n"}}
