A\nfew months ago, I talked to a designer at another company about the insane\namount of time they&#39;re expected to give up to make video games.&quot;\n\nAbajo, el art�culo completo:\n\nComputing Science enrollment rates low because &#39;sexy&#39; design jobs don&#39;t put\nout\n\nDaniel Kaszor\n\nLast week the Computing Science department released statistics saying that\nenrollment in their programs has fallen since the dot-com crash in the early\ndays of this century. While this may be true, I think that this reduction is\ndue to a greater awareness that the so-called &quot;sexy&quot; jobs in the\nindustry-those of video game designers, the ones that still get a large\namount of Comp-Sci grads-are often hellishly difficult. They often have\n80-hour workweeks and no overtime pay, and new recruits to Comp-Sci are\nbecoming aware of that.\n\nRecently Electronic Arts (EA), the largest third-party video game\nsoftware-publisher in the world, finalized a messy and well-publicized\ngrievance by giving a $15.6 million US out- of-court settlement to Jamie\nKirshenbaum, a disgruntled employee who attempted to file a class-action\nlawsuit against EA, contending that he and his fellow employees were\nexpected to work up to 14 hours a day, six or seven days a week, with no\novertime or compensation.\n\nNow this situation isn&#39;t unique to EA. All across the gaming industry,\n80-hour workweeks seem to be the norm. A few months ago, I talked to a\ndesigner at another company about the insane amount of time they&#39;re expected\nto give up to make video games. He didn&#39;t see any way around it, saying that\nit&#39;s a necessity to compete in the marketplace. He also said that he didn&#39;t\nknow how long the industry could sustain itself working its employees\nragged.\n\nThe problem is that, while some people find these titanic piles of\nlife-consuming work palatable, many don&#39;t. And while focusing on the most\nzealous niche might be fine in an emerging industry, it can obviously hurt\nrecruitment for a workforce when the industry in question is maturing.\n\nAnecdotally, as someone not related to the program at all, I know three\npeople who have dropped out of Computing Science or have pursued other\ncareers after completing their degrees. Although they expressed it\ndifferently, the reasons that all three gave for leaving were that they were\nsick of the culture of consuming work, and that they didn&#39;t want to spend\nall their time around people who were willing to accept such a culture. This\nwas because, while there are Comp-Sci jobs that only ask for a regular\nallotment of time, they seemed boring to them-they wanted to go for the\n&quot;sexy&quot; game- industry jobs.\n\nThe thing is that this culture of overwork comes because the employees, to a\ncertain extent, allow it to happen. When it finally becomes too much, the\nunpaid overtime has become part of the culture of the industry. Of course,\nthe most obvious solution to this problem is for the employees to unionize\nor to push existing unions to enforce healthy working practices.\n\nThe gaming industry will resist this move, but they shouldn&#39;t. It should be\nfairly clear that maintaining an industry that requires an expensive degree\nfor employment and also has inhospitable working conditions won&#39;t be able to\nexpand that rapidly. But, despite the logic behind this, the move must be\nregulated by something like a union, because even if a company sees the\nlogic, they can&#39;t survive if other companies are making games the old way,\ntaking half the time or spending half the money of the contentious company.\n\nIn the long run, creating better working conditions will foster an industry\nwhere there are more talented people interested in working in it- people who\nmight have been scared away before. Personally, I don&#39;t see how that can be\na bad thing.\n\nhttp://www.gateway.ualberta.ca/view.php?aid=4897\n\n--\nEste mensaje ha sido analizado por el Antivirus\nde Grupo Alternativa S.A. en busca de virus y otros\ncontenidos peligrosos y se considera que esta limpio.\n\n\n\n"}}
