Why do they\ndie? Why do they want to spend so much of  the  intervening  time\nwearing digital watches?\n \nMany many millions of years ago a race of  hyperintelligent  pan-\ndimensional  beings  (whose  physical  manifestation in their own\npan-dimensional universe is not dissimilar to our own) got so fed\nup  with  the  constant bickering about the meaning of life which\nused to interrupt  their  favourite  pastime  of  Brockian  Ultra\nCricket  (a  curious  game which involved suddenly hitting people\nfor no readily apparent reason and then running away)  that  they\ndecided to sit down and solve their problems once and for all.\n \nAnd to this end they built themselves a stupendous super computer\nwhich  was  so  amazingly  intelligent  that even before the data\nbanks had been connected up it had started from I think therefore\nI  am  and got as far as the existence of rice pudding and income\ntax before anyone managed to turn it off.\n \nIt was the size of a small city.\n \nIts main console was installed in a specially designed  executive\noffice,   mounted   on  an  enormous  executive  desk  of  finest\nultramahagony  topped  with  rich  ultrared  leather.  The   dark\ncarpeting   was  discreetly  sumptuous,  exotic  pot  plants  and\ntastefully engraved prints of the principal computer  programmers\nand  their  families  were deployed liberally about the room, and\nstately windows looked out upon a tree-lined public square.\n \nOn  the  day  of  the  Great  On-Turning  two   soberly   dressed\nprogrammers  with  brief  cases arrived and were shown discreetly\ninto the office.  They  were  aware  that  this  day  they  would\nrepresent  their  entire  race  in  its greatest moment, but they\nconducted themselves calmly and quietly as they seated themselves\ndeferentially  before the desk, opened their brief cases and took\nout their leather-bound notebooks.\n \nTheir names were Lunkwill and Fook.\n \nFor a few moments they sat in  respectful  silence,  then,  after\nexchanging  a quiet glance with Fook, Lunkwill leaned forward and\ntouched a small black panel.\n \nThe subtlest of hums indicated that the massive computer was  now\nin  total  active mode. After a pause it spoke to them in a voice\nrich resonant and deep.\n \nIt said: &quot;What is this great task for which I, Deep Thought,  the\nsecond  greatest  computer in the Universe of Time and Space have\nbeen called into existence?&quot;\n \nLunkwill and Fook glanced at each other in surprise.\n \n &quot;Your task, O Computer ...&quot; began Fook.\n \n&quot;No, wait a minute, this isn&#39;t right,&quot;  said  Lunkwill,  worried.\n&quot;We distinctly designed this computer to be the greatest one ever\nand we&#39;re not making do  with  second  best.  Deep  Thought,&quot;  he\naddressed  the  computer,  &quot;are you not as we designed you to be,\nthe greatest most powerful computer in all time?&quot;\n \n&quot;I  described  myself  as  the  second  greatest,&quot;  intoned  Deep\nThought, &quot;and such I am.&quot;\n \nAnother worried look passed between the two programmers. Lunkwill\ncleared his throat.\n \n&quot;There must be some mistake,&quot; he said, &quot;are you  not  a  greatest\ncomputer  than the Milliard Gargantubrain which can count all the\natoms in a star in a millisecond?&quot;\n \n&quot;The Milliard Gargantubrain?&quot; said Deep Thought with  unconcealed\ncontempt. &quot;A mere abacus - mention it not.&quot;\n \n&quot;And are you  not,&quot;  said  Fook  leaning  anxiously  forward,  &quot;a\ngreater  analyst  than the Googleplex Star Thinker in the Seventh\nGalaxy of Light and Ingenuity which can calculate the  trajectory\nof  every  single  dust particle throughout a five-week Dangrabad\nBeta sand blizzard?&quot;\n \n&quot;A five-week sand blizzard?&quot; said Deep  Thought  haughtily.  &quot;You\nask  this  of  me  who  have contemplated the very vectors of the\natoms in the Big Bang itself? Molest  me  not  with  this  pocket\ncalculator stuff.&quot;\n \nThe two programmers sat in uncomfortable silence  for  a  moment.\nThen Lunkwill leaned forward again.\n \n&quot;But are you not,&quot; he said, &quot;a more fiendish disputant  than  the\nGreat Hyperlobic Omni-Cognate Neutron Wrangler of Ciceronicus 12,\nthe Magic and Indefatigable?&quot;\n \n&quot;The Great Hyperlobic Omni-Cognate Neutron Wrangler,&quot;  said  Deep\nThought thoroughly rolling the r&#39;s, &quot;could talk all four legs off\nan Arcturan MegaDonkey - but only I could persuade it to go for a\nwalk afterwards.&quot;\n \n&quot;Then what,&quot; asked Fook, &quot;is the problem?&quot;\n \n&quot;There is no problem,&quot; said Deep Thought with magnificent ringing\ntones.  &quot;I am simply the second greatest computer in the Universe\nof Space and Time.&quot;\n \n&quot;But the second?&quot; insisted Lunkwill. &quot;Why do you keep saying  the\nsecond?   You&#39;re   surely  not  thinking  of  the  Multicorticoid\nPerspicutron Titan Muller are you? Or  the  Pondermatic?  Or  the\n...&quot;\n \nContemptuous lights flashed across the computer&#39;s console.\n \n&quot;I spare not  a  single  unit  of  thought  on  these  cybernetic\nsimpletons!&quot; he boomed. &quot;I speak of none but the computer that is\nto come after me!&quot;\n \nFook was losing  patience.  He  pushed  his  notebook  aside  and\nmuttered, &quot;I think this is getting needlessly messianic.&quot;\n \n&quot;You know nothing of future time,&quot; pronounced Deep Thought,  &quot;and\nyet  in  my  teeming  circuitry I can navigate the infinite delta\nstreams of future probability and see that  there  must  one  day\ncome  a  computer  whose  merest  operational parameters I am not\nworthy to calculate, but which it will be my fate  eventually  to\ndesign.&quot;\n \nFook sighed heavily and glanced across to Lunkwill.\n \n&quot;Can we get on and ask the question?&quot; he said.\n \nLunkwill motioned him to wait.\n \n&quot;What computer is this of which you speak?&quot; he asked.\n \n&quot;I will speak of it no further in this present time,&quot;  said  Deep\nThought.  &quot;Now. Ask what else of me you will that I may function.\nSpeak.&quot;\n \nThey shrugged at each other. Fook composed himself.\n \n&quot;O Deep Thought Computer,&quot; he said, &quot;the task  we  have  designed\nyou  to  perform  is this. We want you to tell us ...&quot; he paused,\n&quot;... the Answer!&quot;\n \n&quot;The answer?&quot; said Deep Thought. &quot;The answer to what?&quot;\n \n&quot;Life!&quot; urged Fook.\n \n&quot;The Universe!&quot; said Lunkwill.\n \n&quot;Everything!&quot; they said in chorus.\n \nDeep Thought paused for a moment&#39;s reflection.\n \n&quot;Tricky,&quot; he said finally.\n \n&quot;But can you do it?&quot;\n \nAgain, a significant pause.\n \n&quot;Yes,&quot; said Deep Thought, &quot;I can do it.&quot;\n \n&quot;There is an answer?&quot; said Fook with breathless excitement.&quot;\n \n&quot;A simple answer?&quot; added Lunkwill.\n \n&quot;Yes,&quot; said Deep Thought. &quot;Life, the  Universe,  and  Everything.\nThere  is  an  answer.  But,&quot; he added, &quot;I&#39;ll have to think about\nit.&quot;\n \nA sudden commotion destroyed the moment: the door flew  open  and\ntwo  angry  men  wearing the coarse faded-blue robes and belts of\nthe Cruxwan University burst into the room, thrusting  aside  the\nineffectual flunkies who tried to bar their way.\n \n&quot;We demand  admission!&quot;  shouted  the  younger  of  the  two  men\nelbowing a pretty young secretary in the throat.\n \n&quot;Come on,&quot; shouted the older one, &quot;you can&#39;t  keep  us  out!&quot;  He\npushed a junior programmer back through the door.\n \n&quot;We demand that you can&#39;t keep us out!&quot; bawled the  younger  one,\nthough  he was now firmly inside the room and no further attempts\nwere being made to stop him.\n \n&quot;Who are you?&quot; said Lunkwill, rising angrily from his seat. &quot;What\ndo you want?&quot;\n \n&quot;I am Majikthise!&quot; announced the older one.\n \n&quot;And I demand that I am Vroomfondel!&quot; shouted the younger one.\n \nMajikthise turned on Vroomfondel. &quot;It&#39;s  alright,&quot;  he  explained\nangrily, &quot;you don&#39;t need to demand that.&quot;\n \n&quot;Alright!&quot; bawled Vroomfondel banging on an nearby  desk.  &quot;I  am\nVroomfondel, and that is not a demand, that is a solid fact! What\nwe demand is solid facts!&quot;\n \n&quot;No we don&#39;t!&quot;  exclaimed  Majikthise  in  irritation.  &quot;That  is\nprecisely what we don&#39;t demand!&quot;\n \nScarcely pausing  for  breath,  Vroomfondel  shouted,  &quot;We  don&#39;t\ndemand  solid  facts!  What we demand is a total absence of solid\nfacts. I demand that I may or may not be Vroomfondel!&quot;\n \n&quot;But who the devil are you?&quot; exclaimed an outraged Fook.\n \n&quot;We,&quot; said Majikthise, &quot;are Philosophers.&quot;\n \n&quot;Though we may not be,&quot; said Vroomfondel waving a warning  finger\nat the programmers.\n \n&quot;Yes we are,&quot; insisted Majikthise. &quot;We are quite definitely  here\nas  representatives  of  the  Amalgamated  Union of Philosophers,\nSages, Luminaries and Other Thinking Persons, and  we  want  this\nmachine off, and we want it off now!&quot;\n \n&quot;What&#39;s the problem?&quot; said Lunkwill.\n \n&quot;I&#39;ll tell you  what  the  problem  is  mate,&quot;  said  Majikthise,\n&quot;demarcation, that&#39;s the problem!&quot;\n \n&quot;We demand,&quot; yelled Vroomfondel, &quot;that demarcation may or may not\nbe the problem!&quot;\n \n&quot;You just let the machines get on with  the  adding  up,&quot;  warned\nMajikthise,  &quot;and  we&#39;ll  take care of the eternal verities thank\nyou very much. You want to check your legal position you do mate.\nUnder  law  the  Quest  for  Ultimate  Truth is quite clearly the\ninalienable  prerogative of your  working  thinkers.  Any  bloody\nmachine  goes  and  actually finds it and we&#39;re straight out of a\njob aren&#39;t we? I mean what&#39;s the use of our sitting up  half  the\nnight  arguing that there may or may not be a God if this machine\nonly goes and  gives  us  his  bleeding  phone  number  the  next\nmorning?&quot;\n \n&quot;That&#39;s right!&quot; shouted Vroomfondel, &quot;we demand  rigidly  defined\nareas of doubt and uncertainty!&quot;\n \nSuddenly a stentorian voice boomed across the room.\n \n&quot;Might I make  an  observation  at  this  point?&quot;  inquired  Deep\nThought.\n \n&quot;We&#39;ll go on strike!&quot; yelled Vroomfondel.\n \n&quot;That&#39;s  right!&quot;  agreed  Majikthise.  &quot;You&#39;ll  have  a  national\nPhilosopher&#39;s strike on your hands!&quot;\n \nThe hum level in the room suddenly increased as several ancillary\nbass  driver  units,  mounted  in  sedately  carved and varnished\ncabinet speakers around the room, cut in to give  Deep  Thought&#39;s\nvoice a little more power.\n \n&quot;All I wanted  to  say,&quot;  bellowed  the  computer,  &quot;is  that  my\ncircuits  are now irrevocably committed to calculating the answer\nto the Ultimate Question of Life, the Universe, and Everything -&quot;\nhe  paused  and  satisfied  himself  that  he  now had everyone&#39;s\nattention, before continuing more  quietly,  &quot;but  the  programme\nwill take me a little while to run.&quot;\n \nFook glanced impatiently at his watch.\n \n&quot;How long?&quot; he said.\n \n&quot;Seven and a half million years,&quot; said Deep Thought.\n \nLunkwill and Fook blinked at each other.\n \n&quot;Seven and a half million years ...!&quot; they cried in chorus.\n \n&quot;Yes,&quot; declaimed Deep Thought, &quot;I said I&#39;d have  to  think  about\nit,  didn&#39;t  I? And it occurs to me that running a programme like\nthis is bound to create an enormous amount of  popular  publicity\nfor  the whole area of philosophy in general. Everyone&#39;s going to\nhave their own theories about what answer I&#39;m eventually to  come\nup  with,  and who better to capitalize on that media market than\nyou yourself? So long as you can keep disagreeing with each other\nviolently  enough  and  slagging  each  other  off in the popular\npress, you can keep yourself on the gravy  train  for  life.  How\ndoes that sound?&quot;\n \nThe two philosophers gaped at him.\n \n&quot;Bloody  hell,&quot;  said  Majikthise,  &quot;now  that  is  what  I  call\nthinking.  Here Vroomfondel, why do we never think of things like\nthat?&quot;\n \n&quot;Dunno,&quot; said Vroomfondel in an awed whisper, &quot;think  our  brains\nmust be too highly trained Majikthise.&quot;\n \nSo saying, they turned on their heels and walked out of the  door\nand into a lifestyle beyond their wildest dreams.\n \n=================================================================\nChapter 26\n \n&quot;Yes, very  salutary,&quot;  said  Arthur,  after  Slartibartfast  had\nrelated  the  salient  points  of  the story to him, &quot;but I don&#39;t\nunderstand what all this has got to do with the  Earth  and  mice\nand things.&quot;\n \n&quot;That is but the first half of the story Earthman,&quot; said the  old\nman.  &quot;If  you  would  care to discover what happened seven and a\nhalf millions later, on the great day of the Answer, allow me  to\ninvite  you  to  my  study  where  you  can experience the events\nyourself on our Sens-O-Tape records. That  is  unless  you  would\ncare  to  take  a  quick stroll on the surface of New Earth. It&#39;s\nonly half completed I&#39;m afraid - we haven&#39;t even finished burying\nthe  artificial dinosaur skeletons in the crust yet, then we have\nthe Tertiary and Quarternary Periods of the Cenozoic Era  to  lay\ndown, and ...&quot;\n \n&quot;No thank you,&quot; said Arthur, &quot;it wouldn&#39;t be quite the same.&quot;\n \n&quot;No,&quot; said Slartibartfast, &quot;it  won&#39;t  be,&quot;  and  he  turned  the\naircar round and headed back towards the mind-numbing wall.\n \n=================================================================\nChapter 27\n \nSlartibartfast&#39;s study was a total mess, like the results  of  an\nexplosion  in  a  public  library.  The  old  man frowned as they\nstepped in.\n \n&quot;Terribly unfortunate,&quot; he said, &quot;a diode  blew  in  one  of  the\nlife-support  computers.  When  we  tried  to revive our cleaning\nstaff we discovered they&#39;d been dead for nearly  thirty  thousand\nyears.  Who&#39;s  going to clear away the bodies, that&#39;s what I want\nto know. Look why don&#39;t you sit yourself down over there and  let\nme plug you in?&quot;\n \nHe gestured Arthur towards a chair which looked as if it had been\nmade out of the rib cage of a stegosaurus.\n \n&quot;It was made out of the rib cage of a stegosaurus,&quot; explained the\nold  man as he pottered about fishing bits of wire out from under\ntottering piles of paper  and  drawing  instruments.  &quot;Here,&quot;  he\nsaid,  &quot;hold  these,&quot; and passed a couple of stripped wire end to\nArthur.\n \nThe instant he took hold of them a  bird  flew  straight  through\nhim.\n \nHe was suspended in mid-air and  totally  invisible  to  himself.\nBeneath him was a pretty treelined city square, and all around it\nas far as the eye could see were white concrete buildings of airy\nspacious  design  but  somewhat  the  worse  for wear - many were\ncracked and stained with rain. Today however the sun was shining,\na  fresh  breeze  danced  lightly  through the trees, and the odd\nsensation  that  all  the  buildings  were  quietly  humming  was\nprobably  caused  by the fact that the square and all the streets\naround it were thronged with cheerful excited people. Somewhere a\nband  was playing, brightly coloured flags were fluttering in the\nbreeze and the spirit of carnival was in the air.\n \nArthur felt extraordinarily lonely stuck up in the air  above  it\nall without so much as a body to his name, but before he had time\nto reflect on this a voice rang out across the square and  called\nfor everyone&#39;s attention.\n \nA man standing on a brightly dressed  dais  before  the  building\nwhich  clearly dominated the square was addressing the crowd over\na Tannoy.\n \n&quot;O people waiting in the Shadow of Deep Thought!&quot; he  cried  out.\n&quot;Honoured Descendants of Vroomfondel and Majikthise, the Greatest\nand Most Truly Interesting Pundits the Universe  has  ever  known\n... The Time of Waiting is over!&quot;\n \nWild cheers broke out amongst the  crowd.  Flags,  streamers  and\nwolf whistles sailed through the air. The narrower streets looked\nrather like centipedes rolled over on their backs and frantically\nwaving their legs in the air.\n \n&quot;Seven and a half million years our  race  has  waited  for  this\nGreat  and  Hopefully  Enlightening Day!&quot; cried the cheer leader.\n&quot;The Day of the Answer!&quot;\n \nHurrahs burst from the ecstatic crowd.\n \n&quot;Never again,&quot; cried the man, &quot;never again will we wake up in the\nmorning  and  think Who am I? What is my purpose in life? Does it\nreally, cosmically speaking, matter if I don&#39;t get up and  go  to\nwork?  For today we will finally learn once and for all the plain\nand simple answer to all these nagging little problems  of  Life,\nthe Universe and Everything!&quot;\n \nAs the crowd erupted once again,  Arthur  found  himself  gliding\nthrough the air and down towards one of the large stately windows\non the first floor of the building behind the dais from which the\nspeaker was addressing the crowd.\n \nHe experienced a moment&#39;s panic as  he  sailed  straight  through\ntowards  the  window,  which  passed when a second or so later he\nfound  he  had  gone  right  through  the  solid  glass   without\napparently touching it.\n \nNo one in the room remarked on his  peculiar  arrival,  which  is\nhardly  surprising  as  he wasn&#39;t there. He began to realize that\nthe whole experience  was  merely  a  recorded  projection  which\nknocked six-track seventy-millimetre into a cocked hat.\n \nThe room was much as Slartibartfast had described  it.  In  seven\nand  a  half  million  years  it  had  been well looked after and\ncleaned regularly every century or so. The ultramahagony desk was\nworn  at  the edges, the carpet a little faded now, but the large\ncomputer terminal sat in sparkling glory on  the  desk&#39;s  leather\ntop, as bright as if it had been constructed yesterday.\n \nTwo severely dressed men sat respectfully before the terminal and\nwaited.\n \n&quot;The time is nearly upon us,&quot; said one, and Arthur was  surprised\nto  see a word suddenly materialize in thin air just by the man&#39;s\nneck. The word was Loonquawl, and it flashed a  couple  of  times\nand  the  disappeared again. Before Arthur was able to assimilate\nthis the other man spoke and the word  Phouchg  appeared  by  his\nneck.\n \n&quot;Seventy-five thousand generations ago, our  ancestors  set  this\nprogram in motion,&quot; the second man said, &quot;and in all that time we\nwill be the first to hear the computer speak.&quot;\n \n&quot;An awesome prospect, Phouchg,&quot; agreed the first man, and  Arthur\nsuddenly   realized   that  he  was  watching  a  recording  with\nsubtitles.\n \n&quot;We are the ones who will hear,&quot; said Phouchg, &quot;the answer to the\ngreat question of Life ...!&quot;\n \n&quot;The Universe ...!&quot; said Loonquawl.\n \n&quot;And Everything ...!&quot;\n \n&quot;Shhh,&quot; said Loonquawl with  a  slight  gesture,  &quot;I  think  Deep\nThought is preparing to speak!&quot;\n \nThere was a moment&#39;s expectant pause whilst panels slowly came to\nlife  on  the  front  of  the  console. Lights flashed on and off\nexperimentally and settled down into a  businesslike  pattern.  A\nsoft low hum came from the communication channel.\n \n&quot;Good morning,&quot; said Deep Thought at last.\n \n&quot;Er ... Good morning, O Deep Thought,&quot; said Loonquawl  nervously,\n&quot;do you have ... er, that is ...&quot;\n \n&quot;An answer for you?&quot; interrupted Deep Thought majestically. &quot;Yes.\nI have.&quot;\n \nThe two men shivered with expectancy. Their waiting had not  been\nin vain.\n \n&quot;There really is one?&quot; breathed Phouchg.\n \n&quot;There really is one,&quot; confirmed Deep Thought.\n \n&quot;To Everything? To the great Question of Life, the  Universe  and\nEverything?&quot;\n \n&quot;Yes.&quot;\n \nBoth of the men had been trained for this moment, their lives had\nbeen  a  preparation  for  it, they had been selected at birth as\nthose who would witness  the  answer,  but  even  so  they  found\nthemselves gasping and squirming like excited children.\n \n&quot;And you&#39;re ready to give it to us?&quot; urged Loonquawl.\n \n&quot;I am.&quot;\n \n&quot;Now?&quot;\n \n&quot;Now,&quot; said Deep Thought.\n \nThey both licked their dry lips.\n \n&quot;Though I don&#39;t think,&quot; added Deep Thought, &quot;that you&#39;re going to\nlike it.&quot;\n \n&quot;Doesn&#39;t matter!&quot; said Phouchg. &quot;We must know it! Now!&quot;\n \n&quot;Now?&quot; inquired Deep Thought.\n \n&quot;Yes! Now ...&quot;\n \n&quot;Alright,&quot; said the computer and settled into silence again.  The\ntwo men fidgeted. The tension was unbearable.\n \n&quot;You&#39;re really not going to like it,&quot; observed Deep Thought.\n \n&quot;Tell us!&quot;\n \n&quot;Alright,&quot; said Deep Thought. &quot;The Answer to the  Great  Question\n...&quot;\n \n&quot;Yes ...!&quot;\n \n&quot;Of Life, the Universe and Everything ...&quot; said Deep Thought.\n \n&quot;Yes ...!&quot;\n \n&quot;Is ...&quot; said Deep Thought, and paused.\n \n&quot;Yes ...!&quot;\n \n&quot;Is ...&quot;\n \n&quot;Yes ...!!!...?&quot;\n \n&quot;Forty-two,&quot; said Deep Thought, with infinite majesty and calm.\n \n\n===========================================================================\n\nBueno, espero q lo hayan disfrutado todos y nadie se queje por el post\ngrande :).
