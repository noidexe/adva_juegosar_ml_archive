To develop Mazes of Fate, Sabarasa has\nexamined several classic RPGs, trying to distill the\nessence of what made those games so playable and\npopular.

The ancient gods, disgusted by\nhumanity�s pride, intend to wipe mankind out and\nreplace it with a new, more submissive race of\ngoatmen. One party of adventurers is left to make the\nultimate choice. Should they fight back against\noverwhelming odds, or sentence humanity to a fate that\nmay be worse than death?\n\n\n�\n\n\nMazes of Fate spans the length and breadth of a huge,\ndynamic world, and tells an epic story of magic and\nconspiracy, with more than a hundred characters you\ncan interact with, an hour of original music featuring\nthirty-five different themes, and twenty-five hours of\ngameplay.\n\n\n�\n\n\nYou will explore dungeons, solve intricate puzzles,\nand go on multiple quests with a party of up to three\nadventurers. You can select your protagonist from one\nof three pre-made characters, or create your own, then\nseek out and recruit six unlockable allies for your\ncrew. The adventurers can be customized as you see\nfit, using nineteen skills, forty magical spells from\nthree different schools of magic, and more than three\nhundred items and equipment to find and use.\n\n\n�\n\n\nYou will need all the advantages you can get to\novercome hundreds of monsters, unravel the secrets of\nthe gods� plot, and battle your way to the point where\nyou must make the Final Decision that will determine\nthe fate of the world.\n\n\n�\n\n\nMazes of Fate will ship in five languages � English,\nFrench, Spanish, German, and Italian, which you can\nswitch between during gameplay using the in-game\nOptions menu � when it is released this winter.\n\n\n�\n\n\nMazes of Fate is rated T (Teen) by the ESRB, with the\nfollowing descriptors: blood, the use of alcohol, and\nmild fantasy violence.\n\n\n�\n\n\nAbout Signature Devices, Inc. and Graffiti\nEntertainment LLC: \n\n\nBased in Sunnyvale, Calif., Signature Devices, Inc.\n(www.signaturedevices.com) and its wholly owned\nsubsidiary Grafitti Entertainment, LLC\n(www.GraffitiEntertainment.com) are a full-service\ndeveloper and publisher of interactive entertainment\nsoftware for advanced entertainment consoles.� Its\nfocus is on creating, developing, and publishing\ntrend-setting titles with mass-market appeal.\n\n\n\n�\n\n\nSabarasa Entertainment is one of the leading game\ndevelopment companies of Argentina.
