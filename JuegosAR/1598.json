Why do they\n&gt; die? Why do they want to spend so much of  the  intervening  time\n&gt; wearing digital watches?\n&gt;\n&gt; Many many millions of years ago a race of  hyperintelligent  pan-\n&gt; dimensional  beings  (whose  physical  manifestation in their own\n&gt; pan-dimensional universe is not dissimilar to our own) got so fed\n&gt; up  with  the  constant bickering about the meaning of life which\n&gt; used to interrupt  their  favourite  pastime  of  Brockian  Ultra\n&gt; Cricket  (a  curious  game which involved suddenly hitting people\n&gt; for no readily apparent reason and then running away)  that  they\n&gt; decided to sit down and solve their problems once and for all.\n&gt;\n&gt; And to this end they built themselves a stupendous super computer\n&gt; which  was  so  amazingly  intelligent  that even before the data\n&gt; banks had been connected up it had started from I think therefore\n&gt; I  am  and got as far as the existence of rice pudding and income\n&gt; tax before anyone managed to turn it off.\n&gt;\n&gt; It was the size of a small city.\n&gt;\n&gt; Its main console was installed in a specially designed  executive\n&gt; office,   mounted   on  an  enormous  executive  desk  of  finest\n&gt; ultramahagony  topped  with  rich  ultrared  leather.  The   dark\n&gt; carpeting   was  discreetly  sumptuous,  exotic  pot  plants  and\n&gt; tastefully engraved prints of the principal computer  programmers\n&gt; and  their  families  were deployed liberally about the room, and\n&gt; stately windows looked out upon a tree-lined public square.\n&gt;\n&gt; On  the  day  of  the  Great  On-Turning  two   soberly   dressed\n&gt; programmers  with  brief  cases arrived and were shown discreetly\n&gt; into the office.  They  were  aware  that  this  day  they  would\n&gt; represent  their  entire  race  in  its greatest moment, but they\n&gt; conducted themselves calmly and quietly as they seated themselves\n&gt; deferentially  before the desk, opened their brief cases and took\n&gt; out their leather-bound notebooks.\n&gt;\n&gt; Their names were Lunkwill and Fook.\n&gt;\n&gt; For a few moments they sat in  respectful  silence,  then,  after\n&gt; exchanging  a quiet glance with Fook, Lunkwill leaned forward and\n&gt; touched a small black panel.\n&gt;\n&gt; The subtlest of hums indicated that the massive computer was  now\n&gt; in  total  active mode. After a pause it spoke to them in a voice\n&gt; rich resonant and deep.\n&gt;\n&gt; It said: &quot;What is this great task for which I, Deep Thought,  the\n&gt; second  greatest  computer in the Universe of Time and Space have\n&gt; been called into existence?&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Lunkwill and Fook glanced at each other in surprise.\n&gt;\n&gt;  &quot;Your task, O Computer ...&quot; began Fook.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;No, wait a minute, this isn&#39;t right,&quot;  said  Lunkwill,  worried.\n&gt; &quot;We distinctly designed this computer to be the greatest one ever\n&gt; and we&#39;re not making do  with  second  best.  Deep  Thought,&quot;  he\n&gt; addressed  the  computer,  &quot;are you not as we designed you to be,\n&gt; the greatest most powerful computer in all time?&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;I  described  myself  as  the  second  greatest,&quot;  intoned  Deep\n&gt; Thought, &quot;and such I am.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Another worried look passed between the two programmers. Lunkwill\n&gt; cleared his throat.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;There must be some mistake,&quot; he said, &quot;are you  not  a  greatest\n&gt; computer  than the Milliard Gargantubrain which can count all the\n&gt; atoms in a star in a millisecond?&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;The Milliard Gargantubrain?&quot; said Deep Thought with  unconcealed\n&gt; contempt. &quot;A mere abacus - mention it not.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;And are you  not,&quot;  said  Fook  leaning  anxiously  forward,  &quot;a\n&gt; greater  analyst  than the Googleplex Star Thinker in the Seventh\n&gt; Galaxy of Light and Ingenuity which can calculate the  trajectory\n&gt; of  every  single  dust particle throughout a five-week Dangrabad\n&gt; Beta sand blizzard?&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;A five-week sand blizzard?&quot; said Deep  Thought  haughtily.  &quot;You\n&gt; ask  this  of  me  who  have contemplated the very vectors of the\n&gt; atoms in the Big Bang itself? Molest  me  not  with  this  pocket\n&gt; calculator stuff.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; The two programmers sat in uncomfortable silence  for  a  moment.\n&gt; Then Lunkwill leaned forward again.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;But are you not,&quot; he said, &quot;a more fiendish disputant  than  the\n&gt; Great Hyperlobic Omni-Cognate Neutron Wrangler of Ciceronicus 12,\n&gt; the Magic and Indefatigable?&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;The Great Hyperlobic Omni-Cognate Neutron Wrangler,&quot;  said  Deep\n&gt; Thought thoroughly rolling the r&#39;s, &quot;could talk all four legs off\n&gt; an Arcturan MegaDonkey - but only I could persuade it to go for a\n&gt; walk afterwards.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;Then what,&quot; asked Fook, &quot;is the problem?&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;There is no problem,&quot; said Deep Thought with magnificent ringing\n&gt; tones.  &quot;I am simply the second greatest computer in the Universe\n&gt; of Space and Time.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;But the second?&quot; insisted Lunkwill. &quot;Why do you keep saying  the\n&gt; second?   You&#39;re   surely  not  thinking  of  the  Multicorticoid\n&gt; Perspicutron Titan Muller are you? Or  the  Pondermatic?  Or  the\n&gt; ...&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Contemptuous lights flashed across the computer&#39;s console.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;I spare not  a  single  unit  of  thought  on  these  cybernetic\n&gt; simpletons!&quot; he boomed. &quot;I speak of none but the computer that is\n&gt; to come after me!&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Fook was losing  patience.  He  pushed  his  notebook  aside  and\n&gt; muttered, &quot;I think this is getting needlessly messianic.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;You know nothing of future time,&quot; pronounced Deep Thought,  &quot;and\n&gt; yet  in  my  teeming  circuitry I can navigate the infinite delta\n&gt; streams of future probability and see that  there  must  one  day\n&gt; come  a  computer  whose  merest  operational parameters I am not\n&gt; worthy to calculate, but which it will be my fate  eventually  to\n&gt; design.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Fook sighed heavily and glanced across to Lunkwill.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;Can we get on and ask the question?&quot; he said.\n&gt;\n&gt; Lunkwill motioned him to wait.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;What computer is this of which you speak?&quot; he asked.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;I will speak of it no further in this present time,&quot;  said  Deep\n&gt; Thought.  &quot;Now. Ask what else of me you will that I may function.\n&gt; Speak.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; They shrugged at each other. Fook composed himself.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;O Deep Thought Computer,&quot; he said, &quot;the task  we  have  designed\n&gt; you  to  perform  is this. We want you to tell us ...&quot; he paused,\n&gt; &quot;... the Answer!&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;The answer?&quot; said Deep Thought. &quot;The answer to what?&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;Life!&quot; urged Fook.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;The Universe!&quot; said Lunkwill.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;Everything!&quot; they said in chorus.\n&gt;\n&gt; Deep Thought paused for a moment&#39;s reflection.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;Tricky,&quot; he said finally.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;But can you do it?&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Again, a significant pause.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;Yes,&quot; said Deep Thought, &quot;I can do it.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;There is an answer?&quot; said Fook with breathless excitement.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;A simple answer?&quot; added Lunkwill.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;Yes,&quot; said Deep Thought. &quot;Life, the  Universe,  and  Everything.\n&gt; There  is  an  answer.  But,&quot; he added, &quot;I&#39;ll have to think about\n&gt; it.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; A sudden commotion destroyed the moment: the door flew  open  and\n&gt; two  angry  men  wearing the coarse faded-blue robes and belts of\n&gt; the Cruxwan University burst into the room, thrusting  aside  the\n&gt; ineffectual flunkies who tried to bar their way.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;We demand  admission!&quot;  shouted  the  younger  of  the  two  men\n&gt; elbowing a pretty young secretary in the throat.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;Come on,&quot; shouted the older one, &quot;you can&#39;t  keep  us  out!&quot;  He\n&gt; pushed a junior programmer back through the door.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;We demand that you can&#39;t keep us out!&quot; bawled the  younger  one,\n&gt; though  he was now firmly inside the room and no further attempts\n&gt; were being made to stop him.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;Who are you?&quot; said Lunkwill, rising angrily from his seat. &quot;What\n&gt; do you want?&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;I am Majikthise!&quot; announced the older one.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;And I demand that I am Vroomfondel!&quot; shouted the younger one.\n&gt;\n&gt; Majikthise turned on Vroomfondel. &quot;It&#39;s  alright,&quot;  he  explained\n&gt; angrily, &quot;you don&#39;t need to demand that.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;Alright!&quot; bawled Vroomfondel banging on an nearby  desk.  &quot;I  am\n&gt; Vroomfondel, and that is not a demand, that is a solid fact! What\n&gt; we demand is solid facts!&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;No we don&#39;t!&quot;  exclaimed  Majikthise  in  irritation.  &quot;That  is\n&gt; precisely what we don&#39;t demand!&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Scarcely pausing  for  breath,  Vroomfondel  shouted,  &quot;We  don&#39;t\n&gt; demand  solid  facts!  What we demand is a total absence of solid\n&gt; facts. I demand that I may or may not be Vroomfondel!&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;But who the devil are you?&quot; exclaimed an outraged Fook.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;We,&quot; said Majikthise, &quot;are Philosophers.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;Though we may not be,&quot; said Vroomfondel waving a warning  finger\n&gt; at the programmers.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;Yes we are,&quot; insisted Majikthise. &quot;We are quite definitely  here\n&gt; as  representatives  of  the  Amalgamated  Union of Philosophers,\n&gt; Sages, Luminaries and Other Thinking Persons, and  we  want  this\n&gt; machine off, and we want it off now!&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;What&#39;s the problem?&quot; said Lunkwill.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;I&#39;ll tell you  what  the  problem  is  mate,&quot;  said  Majikthise,\n&gt; &quot;demarcation, that&#39;s the problem!&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;We demand,&quot; yelled Vroomfondel, &quot;that demarcation may or may not\n&gt; be the problem!&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;You just let the machines get on with  the  adding  up,&quot;  warned\n&gt; Majikthise,  &quot;and  we&#39;ll  take care of the eternal verities thank\n&gt; you very much. You want to check your legal position you do mate.\n&gt; Under  law  the  Quest  for  Ultimate  Truth is quite clearly the\n&gt; inalienable  prerogative of your  working  thinkers.  Any  bloody\n&gt; machine  goes  and  actually finds it and we&#39;re straight out of a\n&gt; job aren&#39;t we? I mean what&#39;s the use of our sitting up  half  the\n&gt; night  arguing that there may or may not be a God if this machine\n&gt; only goes and  gives  us  his  bleeding  phone  number  the  next\n&gt; morning?&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;That&#39;s right!&quot; shouted Vroomfondel, &quot;we demand  rigidly  defined\n&gt; areas of doubt and uncertainty!&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Suddenly a stentorian voice boomed across the room.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;Might I make  an  observation  at  this  point?&quot;  inquired  Deep\n&gt; Thought.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;We&#39;ll go on strike!&quot; yelled Vroomfondel.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;That&#39;s  right!&quot;  agreed  Majikthise.  &quot;You&#39;ll  have  a  national\n&gt; Philosopher&#39;s strike on your hands!&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; The hum level in the room suddenly increased as several ancillary\n&gt; bass  driver  units,  mounted  in  sedately  carved and varnished\n&gt; cabinet speakers around the room, cut in to give  Deep  Thought&#39;s\n&gt; voice a little more power.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;All I wanted  to  say,&quot;  bellowed  the  computer,  &quot;is  that  my\n&gt; circuits  are now irrevocably committed to calculating the answer\n&gt; to the Ultimate Question of Life, the Universe, and Everything -&quot;\n&gt; he  paused  and  satisfied  himself  that  he  now had everyone&#39;s\n&gt; attention, before continuing more  quietly,  &quot;but  the  programme\n&gt; will take me a little while to run.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Fook glanced impatiently at his watch.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;How long?&quot; he said.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;Seven and a half million years,&quot; said Deep Thought.\n&gt;\n&gt; Lunkwill and Fook blinked at each other.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;Seven and a half million years ...!&quot; they cried in chorus.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;Yes,&quot; declaimed Deep Thought, &quot;I said I&#39;d have  to  think  about\n&gt; it,  didn&#39;t  I? And it occurs to me that running a programme like\n&gt; this is bound to create an enormous amount of  popular  publicity\n&gt; for  the whole area of philosophy in general. Everyone&#39;s going to\n&gt; have their own theories about what answer I&#39;m eventually to  come\n&gt; up  with,  and who better to capitalize on that media market than\n&gt; you yourself? So long as you can keep disagreeing with each other\n&gt; violently  enough  and  slagging  each  other  off in the popular\n&gt; press, you can keep yourself on the gravy  train  for  life.  How\n&gt; does that sound?&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; The two philosophers gaped at him.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;Bloody  hell,&quot;  said  Majikthise,  &quot;now  that  is  what  I  call\n&gt; thinking.  Here Vroomfondel, why do we never think of things like\n&gt; that?&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;Dunno,&quot; said Vroomfondel in an awed whisper, &quot;think  our  brains\n&gt; must be too highly trained Majikthise.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; So saying, they turned on their heels and walked out of the  door\n&gt; and into a lifestyle beyond their wildest dreams.\n&gt;\n&gt; =================================================================\n&gt; Chapter 26\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;Yes, very  salutary,&quot;  said  Arthur,  after  Slartibartfast  had\n&gt; related  the  salient  points  of  the story to him, &quot;but I don&#39;t\n&gt; understand what all this has got to do with the  Earth  and  mice\n&gt; and things.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;That is but the first half of the story Earthman,&quot; said the  old\n&gt; man.  &quot;If  you  would  care to discover what happened seven and a\n&gt; half millions later, on the great day of the Answer, allow me  to\n&gt; invite  you  to  my  study  where  you  can experience the events\n&gt; yourself on our Sens-O-Tape records. That  is  unless  you  would\n&gt; care  to  take  a  quick stroll on the surface of New Earth. It&#39;s\n&gt; only half completed I&#39;m afraid - we haven&#39;t even finished burying\n&gt; the  artificial dinosaur skeletons in the crust yet, then we have\n&gt; the Tertiary and Quarternary Periods of the Cenozoic Era  to  lay\n&gt; down, and ...&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;No thank you,&quot; said Arthur, &quot;it wouldn&#39;t be quite the same.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;No,&quot; said Slartibartfast, &quot;it  won&#39;t  be,&quot;  and  he  turned  the\n&gt; aircar round and headed back towards the mind-numbing wall.\n&gt;\n&gt; =================================================================\n&gt; Chapter 27\n&gt;\n&gt; Slartibartfast&#39;s study was a total mess, like the results  of  an\n&gt; explosion  in  a  public  library.  The  old  man frowned as they\n&gt; stepped in.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;Terribly unfortunate,&quot; he said, &quot;a diode  blew  in  one  of  the\n&gt; life-support  computers.  When  we  tried  to revive our cleaning\n&gt; staff we discovered they&#39;d been dead for nearly  thirty  thousand\n&gt; years.  Who&#39;s  going to clear away the bodies, that&#39;s what I want\n&gt; to know. Look why don&#39;t you sit yourself down over there and  let\n&gt; me plug you in?&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; He gestured Arthur towards a chair which looked as if it had been\n&gt; made out of the rib cage of a stegosaurus.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;It was made out of the rib cage of a stegosaurus,&quot; explained the\n&gt; old  man as he pottered about fishing bits of wire out from under\n&gt; tottering piles of paper  and  drawing  instruments.  &quot;Here,&quot;  he\n&gt; said,  &quot;hold  these,&quot; and passed a couple of stripped wire end to\n&gt; Arthur.\n&gt;\n&gt; The instant he took hold of them a  bird  flew  straight  through\n&gt; him.\n&gt;\n&gt; He was suspended in mid-air and  totally  invisible  to  himself.\n&gt; Beneath him was a pretty treelined city square, and all around it\n&gt; as far as the eye could see were white concrete buildings of airy\n&gt; spacious  design  but  somewhat  the  worse  for wear - many were\n&gt; cracked and stained with rain. Today however the sun was shining,\n&gt; a  fresh  breeze  danced  lightly  through the trees, and the odd\n&gt; sensation  that  all  the  buildings  were  quietly  humming  was\n&gt; probably  caused  by the fact that the square and all the streets\n&gt; around it were thronged with cheerful excited people. Somewhere a\n&gt; band  was playing, brightly coloured flags were fluttering in the\n&gt; breeze and the spirit of carnival was in the air.\n&gt;\n&gt; Arthur felt extraordinarily lonely stuck up in the air  above  it\n&gt; all without so much as a body to his name, but before he had time\n&gt; to reflect on this a voice rang out across the square and  called\n&gt; for everyone&#39;s attention.\n&gt;\n&gt; A man standing on a brightly dressed  dais  before  the  building\n&gt; which  clearly dominated the square was addressing the crowd over\n&gt; a Tannoy.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;O people waiting in the Shadow of Deep Thought!&quot; he  cried  out.\n&gt; &quot;Honoured Descendants of Vroomfondel and Majikthise, the Greatest\n&gt; and Most Truly Interesting Pundits the Universe  has  ever  known\n&gt; ... The Time of Waiting is over!&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Wild cheers broke out amongst the  crowd.  Flags,  streamers  and\n&gt; wolf whistles sailed through the air. The narrower streets looked\n&gt; rather like centipedes rolled over on their backs and frantically\n&gt; waving their legs in the air.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;Seven and a half million years our  race  has  waited  for  this\n&gt; Great  and  Hopefully  Enlightening Day!&quot; cried the cheer leader.\n&gt; &quot;The Day of the Answer!&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Hurrahs burst from the ecstatic crowd.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;Never again,&quot; cried the man, &quot;never again will we wake up in the\n&gt; morning  and  think Who am I? What is my purpose in life? Does it\n&gt; really, cosmically speaking, matter if I don&#39;t get up and  go  to\n&gt; work?  For today we will finally learn once and for all the plain\n&gt; and simple answer to all these nagging little problems  of  Life,\n&gt; the Universe and Everything!&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; As the crowd erupted once again,  Arthur  found  himself  gliding\n&gt; through the air and down towards one of the large stately windows\n&gt; on the first floor of the building behind the dais from which the\n&gt; speaker was addressing the crowd.\n&gt;\n&gt; He experienced a moment&#39;s panic as  he  sailed  straight  through\n&gt; towards  the  window,  which  passed when a second or so later he\n&gt; found  he  had  gone  right  through  the  solid  glass   without\n&gt; apparently touching it.\n&gt;\n&gt; No one in the room remarked on his  peculiar  arrival,  which  is\n&gt; hardly  surprising  as  he wasn&#39;t there. He began to realize that\n&gt; the whole experience  was  merely  a  recorded  projection  which\n&gt; knocked six-track seventy-millimetre into a cocked hat.\n&gt;\n&gt; The room was much as Slartibartfast had described  it.  In  seven\n&gt; and  a  half  million  years  it  had  been well looked after and\n&gt; cleaned regularly every century or so. The ultramahagony desk was\n&gt; worn  at  the edges, the carpet a little faded now, but the large\n&gt; computer terminal sat in sparkling glory on  the  desk&#39;s  leather\n&gt; top, as bright as if it had been constructed yesterday.\n&gt;\n&gt; Two severely dressed men sat respectfully before the terminal and\n&gt; waited.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;The time is nearly upon us,&quot; said one, and Arthur was  surprised\n&gt; to  see a word suddenly materialize in thin air just by the man&#39;s\n&gt; neck. The word was Loonquawl, and it flashed a  couple  of  times\n&gt; and  the  disappeared again. Before Arthur was able to assimilate\n&gt; this the other man spoke and the word  Phouchg  appeared  by  his\n&gt; neck.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;Seventy-five thousand generations ago, our  ancestors  set  this\n&gt; program in motion,&quot; the second man said, &quot;and in all that time we\n&gt; will be the first to hear the computer speak.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;An awesome prospect, Phouchg,&quot; agreed the first man, and  Arthur\n&gt; suddenly   realized   that  he  was  watching  a  recording  with\n&gt; subtitles.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;We are the ones who will hear,&quot; said Phouchg, &quot;the answer to the\n&gt; great question of Life ...!&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;The Universe ...!&quot; said Loonquawl.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;And Everything ...!&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;Shhh,&quot; said Loonquawl with  a  slight  gesture,  &quot;I  think  Deep\n&gt; Thought is preparing to speak!&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; There was a moment&#39;s expectant pause whilst panels slowly came to\n&gt; life  on  the  front  of  the  console. Lights flashed on and off\n&gt; experimentally and settled down into a  businesslike  pattern.  A\n&gt; soft low hum came from the communication channel.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;Good morning,&quot; said Deep Thought at last.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;Er ... Good morning, O Deep Thought,&quot; said Loonquawl  nervously,\n&gt; &quot;do you have ... er, that is ...&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;An answer for you?&quot; interrupted Deep Thought majestically. &quot;Yes.\n&gt; I have.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; The two men shivered with expectancy. Their waiting had not  been\n&gt; in vain.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;There really is one?&quot; breathed Phouchg.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;There really is one,&quot; confirmed Deep Thought.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;To Everything? To the great Question of Life, the  Universe  and\n&gt; Everything?&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;Yes.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Both of the men had been trained for this moment, their lives had\n&gt; been  a  preparation  for  it, they had been selected at birth as\n&gt; those who would witness  the  answer,  but  even  so  they  found\n&gt; themselves gasping and squirming like excited children.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;And you&#39;re ready to give it to us?&quot; urged Loonquawl.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;I am.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;Now?&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;Now,&quot; said Deep Thought.\n&gt;\n&gt; They both licked their dry lips.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;Though I don&#39;t think,&quot; added Deep Thought, &quot;that you&#39;re going to\n&gt; like it.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;Doesn&#39;t matter!&quot; said Phouchg. &quot;We must know it! Now!&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;Now?&quot; inquired Deep Thought.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;Yes! Now ...&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;Alright,&quot; said the computer and settled into silence again.  The\n&gt; two men fidgeted. The tension was unbearable.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;You&#39;re really not going to like it,&quot; observed Deep Thought.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;Tell us!&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;Alright,&quot; said Deep Thought. &quot;The Answer to the  Great  Question\n&gt; ...&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;Yes ...!&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;Of Life, the Universe and Everything ...&quot; said Deep Thought.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;Yes ...!&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;Is ...&quot; said Deep Thought, and paused.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;Yes ...!&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;Is ...&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;Yes ...!!!...?&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;Forty-two,&quot; said Deep Thought, with infinite majesty and calm.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n===========================================================================\n&gt;\n&gt; Bueno, espero q lo hayan disfrutado todos y nadie se queje por el post\n&gt; grande :).
