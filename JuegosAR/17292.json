I studied Computer Science with a \nfocus in game development and grap=\r\nhics all through college and worked \nat (nombre de la coma=F1=EDa) which wa=\r\ns fun.  When I began working on \nAdvergames it was great!  I loved the envi=\r\nronment and the people I \nworked with in the industry.  The game industry e=\r\nncourages the use of \ncreativity and your artistic abilities which is aweso=\r\nme.  However, \neveryone wants to get into the game industry so it has cause=\r\nd a flood \nof programmers wanting to work.  This has caused problems with t=\r\nhe \ncompanies treating their employees with the compensations they \ndeserve=\r\n and very little benefits.  If you enjoy programming graphics \nand a fun, e=\r\nxciting environment and low pay, the game industry is \ngreat.  But it&#39;s har=\r\nd to enjoy your work when you aren&#39;t getting paid \nenough to live on.  This=\r\n disappointed me because I focused on it so \nmuch in college.  However, it =\r\nallowed me to utilize most of my \nprogramming skills in sound, memory manag=\r\nement, graphics, \noptimization, networking, etc=85.\n\nAnother point to think=\r\n about is most game development companies are \nsmall which limits the abili=\r\nty to move up and around in a company.  I \nworked at (nombre de la compa=F1=\r\n=EDa) for two years and received only one \nraise of $0.50 an hour and no bo=\r\nnuses.  I was rated one of the better \nand more experienced programmers so =\r\nit really sucked. Also, there was \nno chance of me moving into a better pos=\r\nition with more \nresponsibility other than a coder.\n\nOverall, it is a caree=\r\nr I would definitely go back to but only if I \ndidn&#39;t have to worry about m=\r\ny financial future.  That is the only \nreason I am not working in games.\n\n\n=\r\nEspero que sirva de alg=FAn modo.\n\n\n\n\n"}}
