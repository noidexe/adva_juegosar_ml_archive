To develop for it,\nyou need:\n\n- The DirectX 8 Platform Adaptation Kit\n- Embedded Visual C++ Platform Development Kit (Windows CE version)\n- Xbox Prototype Kit (XPK)\n\nAll are free of charge (minus nominal shipping/CD fee), and I think all are\navailable for download (no MSDN membership needed either).\n\nIn fact, Microsoft has done a very good thing with their Xbox Independent\nDeveloper Program. Not only do they allow 3rd party developers access to\ntheir SDKs for the XBOX, they even allow them to publish games, too. Of\ncourse, your game still would have to be GOOD, and you would need to have a\ncontract with a licensed XBOX Game Distributor before you could have a\nchance seeing it in places like Wal-Mart. But as far as having a Sony\nQuality Engineer hover over you just to get at the development kits, there\nis nothing like that with the XBOX that I can see.\n\nOf course, this also means you can create games and demos for the XBOX using\nthe above development packages and a CD-RW drive (or DVD-RAM/ROM drive,\nwhich the XBOX also supports).\n\nThis is a far cry from what Sony or Nintendo would even think of doing.\n\nSee: http://www.microsoft.com/PressPass/press/2000/Nov00/XPKPR.asp for more info.\nAlso see here for a cool X-BOX OpenGL screenshoot:\nhttp://www.microsoft.com/presspass/images/features/2001/05-16xbox-fullsize.jpg\n(Yes, the XBOX does do OpenGL, and Nascar Heat uses it exclusively)\n\n\nJohnathan\n\n&quot;Martyn Dobson&quot; &lt;martyn_dobson@...&gt; wrote in message\nnews:3b307aec_3@......\n&gt; Doesn&#39;t the xbox run Windows CE ?? If so then they could miss out the whole\n&gt; ICD driver interface and code a version of directx more specifically for the\n&gt; machine, seen as though the hardware shouldn&#39;t change much?!? Then that will\n&gt; mean no OpenGL.\n&gt;\n&gt; M.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Ruud van Gaal &lt;ruud@...&gt; wrote in message\n&gt; news:3b33710e.52681061@......\n&gt; &gt; On Wed, 20 Jun 2001 09:23:19 +0200, &quot;Gernot.Frisch&quot;\n&gt; &gt; &lt;Gernot.Frisch@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;Hi,\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;Some questions about the XBox.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;- Will it support OpenGL? I mean NVidia chips are known for good OpenGL\n&gt; &gt; &gt;drivers\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; I do think so. I know WindowsXP supports OpenGL(1.1), and that\n&gt; &gt; pressure is too high for MS NOT to put OpenGL on the X-Box.\n&gt; &gt; Fortunately.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;- Will a nobody like me and others be able to develop for the XBox?\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; I think there&#39;s a certain quality assurance that is needed to release\n&gt; &gt; stuff for the X-Box. Although ofcourse, in this world, I would not be\n&gt; &gt; surprised if software for the X-Box can be ported easily (it uses\n&gt; &gt; DX8.1) and the mess of the PC floods over to the X-Box. ;)\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;- Has anyone seen a SDK for it, yet?\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; It&#39;s available, but not for free, IIRC.
