The \ncurrent ad situation combined with the very expensive FTP costs makes \nit impossible for us to survive any longer. ZDNet has been kind \nenough to give us time to say good bye and even choose the day that \nwe will close, September 14, our 4 Year Anniversary. Its been a hell \nof a ride since we started out doing this as just a hobby page and \nhave grown to about 800,000 visitors per day. Those of you using the \nfree email service, it should stay online for quite some time so \ndon&#39;t fear. :) \nWe would first and foremost like to thank YOU for making us this \nbig!! That said, we wanted to thank a few friends who we feel also \nhad a hand: Billy Wilson and the gang at Voodoo Extreme.com, Blue and \nFrans at BluesNews.com, Walnut Creek CDROM (provided years of free \nFTP space) and of course the gang at GameSpot who we will never \nforget. There are many others, but it would take pages. Please visit \nour links section to visit some of our other friends. Ben can be \nvisited at 3DCOOL.COM Inc. and I (Tim) have a few other projects in \nmind and will be heard from again :) \n\nWe will update this blurb over the coming days if anything else comes \nto mind and mainly to leave contact email addresses should anyone \nlike to get ahold of us. Currently we are tim@... & \nben@.... We have and are reading EACH and every email your \nsending but regret we cant respond to them all, so dont be offended \nby a lack of response. All I can say from what I have read is YOU \nGUYS ROCK! \n\nOh, and don&#39;t forget to check back Friday night for the Wolfenstein \nMultiplayer demo....... :-) \n\n\n\n"}}
