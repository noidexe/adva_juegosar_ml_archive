Big budget, high production quality; not\napplicable to someone&#39;s first product. Likely return: 200,000\nunits at least, top out at five million in their lifetime.\nRequires massive distribution. \n\nAAA Game Type 2 - The $40 new franchise title (Rollercoaster\nTycoon, Elite Forces, Daikatana). Big budget games typically,\nbut sometimes a surprisingly low budget offering gets in there\nthat simply is very well implemented. (All developers should\nworship Chris Sawyer, he is your god now). These are hit and\nmiss: You can&#39;t publish these mega hits on your own, you have to\nsign up with a major publisher and make sure that whoever is\nmaking the decisions loves your game enough to push it. These\ncan still bomb. Likely return: 15,000 to massive numbers.\nSuccess is very rare. If they do succeed, they usually move into\nthe first category. \n\nA Game Type 1 - This is the $25+ game of all types; slightly\nlower budget than the previous group. The difference between the\ntwo types are pretty blurred but price point is usually the key\nand they are still put into retail by the publisher. Again,\ndeveloper has to sign up with a publisher. This title may or may\nnot get mentioned at E3, may or may not get marketing assigned\nto it and may or may not get a retail push. (Warlords Battlecry,\nStarfleet Command, Master of Orion, Call to Power,\nCaesar/Pharaoh, Battlezone). These titles represent the more\nstandard game you&#39;ll find at retail. They are the products\ngamers are familiar with but your neighbor will never hear of.\nLikely return: 15,000 to 250,000 with the average being more\ntowards 30,000. \n\nA Game Type 2 - Same as above except sold electronically or\nself-published at retail (the classic indie games -- Space\nEmpires IV, The Corporate Machine, Combat Mission). Because\nthey&#39;re self-published and sold primarily electronically, the\nbudget is usually focused more on gameplay. They typically won&#39;t\nhave cutscenes, ala Warlords Battlecry, saving on budget. Likely\nreturn: 5,000 to 100,000 with most of them falling between\n10,000 and 20,000. There are lots and lots of games released\neach year of this category, we only hear about the few that are\nfairly successful or really well received. \n\nB Game Type 1 - This is the $20 game. It can be a really clever\nsmall game or a not so clever small game. Usually low budget, at\nthe stores targeting mainstream consumers rather than gamers\nspecifically. Once again, developer will have to find a\npublisher for their title and hope and pray that they push it\nmassively into retail or else that advance on royalties (if you\ngot one) is definitely all you&#39;ll ever see. Deer Hunting games,\nclassic arcade titles, remade classic arcade games are typical\nhere. These are all over the place in sales (1000 to 5 million),\nbut for the most part, they do less than 10,000 units. \n\nB Game Type 2 - Same as above except &quot;self published:&quot; This\nmeans sold electronically. Almost certain to sell less than\n10,000 units even if it&#39;s a great game. If sold electronically,\nsales are a function of downloads. Look at how many downloads\nthe game is getting, multiply it by 0.01 and that&#39;s how many\nsales they&#39;re getting. If you want to sell 10,000 real units,\nthen you&#39;ll need 1 million downloads of your game. Good luck. \n\nC Game Type - The asteroid clones -- very small scale shareware\ngames. Again, basically a function of number of downloads.\nTypical sales are 500 to 5000. \n\n--------\n\nSeg�n esa clasificaci�n, Icy Tower ser�a B2 (o C, pero me parece\nque C es m�s chico todav�a), y mi desarrollo actual B2... O\nquiz�s A, no conozco ninguno de los ejemplos del tipo A as� que\nno estoy muy seguro de qu� est� hablando Willis.\n\nSaludos,\n\nH. Hern�n Moraldo\nH.
