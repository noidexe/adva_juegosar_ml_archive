Our organization has come a very long way in its relevance \nand usefulness to game developers. In fact, I feel great pressure to help \nus continue evolving and producing at such a stratospheric rate.\n\nTo keep the momentum going, we need you!\n\nHere are seven easy ways you can help, in order of time/money commitment:\n\n7) Refer a friend for membership. Badger if necessary!\n\n6) Become a full member yourself (if you are not already). Aside from any \npersonal time invested, your dues alone support many of the projects that \nwill bear fruit in the upcoming year.\n\n5) Attend a local chapter meeting. Many are more social than &quot;work&quot;; others \nare structured and extremely informative.\n\n4) Speak at a local chapter meeting, at a school, or at GDC. If you&#39;re an \nexperienced developer, you have knowledge that&#39;s worth sharing.\n\n3) Hook up with a committee. That can mean anything from writing part of a \npaper to giving an interview for research.\n\n2) Sign your company up as a Studio Affiliate or Partner. Developers gain \nmembership for their entire staff; other interested companies gain access \nto the community and financially support the cause.\n\n1) Start a committee or project. If the IGDA isn&#39;t doing something you \nconsider essential, get a group of like minds together to tackle it. We \ncan&#39;t survive on &quot;Someone should really...&quot; - that someone is you!\n\nPlease do visit the IGDA booth in the Kentia Foyer at E3 for more \ninformation. Good luck at the show!\n\nWarm regards -\n\nKathy Schoback\nChairperson, IGDA\nkshoback@...\n\n\n\n===========\n1:IGDA News\n===========\n\nFree Business Resources for Game Developers\n-------------------------------------------\nThe IGDA&#39;s Business Committee has delivered resources for the game \ndevelopment community to improve game development contracts, streamline the \ngame submission process to publishers, and educate developers on game \nindustry best practices.\n\nThe following three business resources are available at no charge to IGDA \nmembers and free registered users:\n\n- Contract Walk-Through\n- Game Submission Guide\n- Best Practice Reports\n\nhttp://www.igda.org/biz/\n\n\n\nNew Board Members and Officers\n------------------------------\nThe new members of the Board of Directors are John Feil, Level Designer, \nLucas Arts; Mitzi McGilvray, Executive Producer, Tapwave; and Jesse Schell, \nProfessor of Entertainment Technology, Carnegie Mellon University. They \nwere elected to the open board seats by the membership. The new board term \nbegan on May 1, 2003. New officers chosen by the board are \nChairperson: Kathy Schoback, Director of Product Operations, Eidos \nInteractive; Secretary: Jesse Schell, and Treasurer: Mitzi McGilvray.\n\nhttp://www.igda.org/newsroom/press_050803.php\nhttp://www.igda.org/board/\n\n\n\nThe IGDA @ E3\n-------------\nAs in years past, the IGDA will have a presence at the big E3 show. IGDA \nmembers can chill out in our member lounge in the Kentia Foyer area - kick \nback on a cozy couch and enjoy some free refreshments (this is a members \nonly lounge).\n\nFurther, the IGDA&#39;s program director, Jason Della Rocca, will be moderating \na panel titled &quot;Grow Your Career in the Game Industry&quot; with such esteemed \npanelists as Karthik Bala (Vicarious Visions), John Buchanan (EA), Don \nDaglow (Stormfront Studios) and David Perry (Shiny).\n\nAlso, the IGDA&#39;s Online Games Committee will be meeting in room 404B from \n4-5pm on Wednesday, May 14th. This will be the kick-off session for the \ncoming year&#39;s projects and anyone wishing to contribute (writing, editing, \nresearching, etc) is encouraged to attend.\n\nFinally, the IGDA&#39;s Women in Game Development Committee will host an \ninformal breakfast gathering in the Veranda room of the Figueroa Hotel at \n8am on Thursday, May 15th.\n\nhttp://www.e3expo.com/\n\n\n\nIndependent Game Development SIG Re-Launched\n--------------------------------------------\nThe IGDA has just re-launched its Independent Game Development Special \nInterest Group. The purpose of the Indie SIG is to provide information and \nresources to help and support independent game developers. The current \nfocus of the SIG is to provide indie-oriented articles and interviews on a \nregular basis.\n\nThe Indie SIG is also starting up an indie mailing list for in-depth \ndiscussion of what it means to be a successful indie developer.\n\n(Many of you will note that SIGs were on a hiatus over the 2002-2003 \nholidays as the IGDA web site was updated... We are still in the process of \nupdating/revamping all our SIGs. Big thanks to Brian Hook for helping push \nthis one through.)\n\nhttp://www.igda.org/indie/\n\n\n\nColumns Updated\n---------------\nOur monthly columns have all been updated for May:\n\n- The Ivory Tower:\nInto the Labyrinth: Defining Games Research\nhttp://www.igda.org/columns/ivorytower/\n\n\n- Famous Last Words:\nResearching a Publisher&#39;s Financials\nhttp://www.igda.org/columns/lastwords/\n\n\n- Culture Clash:\nInnovation: The Sincerest Form of Flattery - Games can tell a better story\nhttp://www.igda.org/columns/clash/\n\n\n- The Games Game:\nThe Elusive Game Designer\nhttp://www.igda.org/columns/gamesgame/\n\n\n\n=================\n2:Chapter Updates\n=================\n\nMalmo\nMeeting, May &gt; Nordic Chapter Meeting!\nhttp://www.igda.org/malmo\n\n\nMidlands UK\nReport, April &gt; Andrew Oliver Guest Speaker\nhttp://www.igda.org/midlands/MidlandsReport3/Event3.htm\n\n\nSouthern Michigan\nReport, April &gt; GDC Wrap-up and &quot;Made In Michigan&quot; Game Previews\nhttp://www.igda.org/smichigan/Apr03/report.htm\n\n\nVancouver\nReport, April &gt; Exiles talk Proof of Concept\nhttp://www.igda.org/vancouver/reports.htm\n\n\nAmsterdam\nReport, May &gt; Chapter Meeting 24 April Report and Pictures\nhttp://www.fjbproductions.com/IGDAAC/20030424.html\n\n\nSan Francisco\nReport, May &gt; Adapting Lord of the Rings\nhttp://www.igda.org/sanfran/bayarea_summary_Apr03.htm\n\n\nSwitzerland\nMeeting, June &gt; Grill at the river bank or a gathering of friends\nhttp://www.igda.org/swiss/\n\n\n\n===============\n3:Industry News\n===============\n\nThe Right to Virtually Assemble\nhttp://www.igda.org/Forums/showthread.php?threadid=5205\n\n\nUS Justice Department Seizes Piracy Site\nhttp://www.igda.org/Forums/showthread.php?threadid=5194\n\n\nGames, Not School, Teaching Kids to Think\nhttp://www.igda.org/Forums/showthread.php?threadid=5125\n\n\n\n==========================\n4:Upcoming Industry Events\n==========================\n\nE3\nhttp://www.e3expo.com/\n13-16 May, Los Angeles, CA\n\n\nDigital Arts and Culture\nhttp://hypertext.rmit.edu.au/dac/\n19-23 May, Melbourne, Australia\n\n\nNetGames\nhttp://confman.eecs.umich.edu/netgames2003/\n22-23 May, Redwood City, CA\n\n\nHow to compete in the global game\nhttp://www.globalwatchonline.net/itp/ttpevdy.Aspx\n11 June, London, UK\n\n\nELSPA Games Summit\nhttp://www.elspa.com/serv/eventsFull.asp?ID=3\n17-18 June, London, UK\n\n\n\n=================\n4 Logistical Bits\n=================\n\nThanks to our Partners!\n-----------------------\nThe IGDA extends its sincerest thanks to all our Partners!
