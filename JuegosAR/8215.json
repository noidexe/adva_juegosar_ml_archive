(VSI) to examine the legal \nimplications of open source software. His 123-page, highly-detailed \nstudy comes to several conclusions that could make many existing and \npotential users of open source software think twice about running the \nincreasingly popular &quot;free&quot; software on their computers. Among them: \nThe General Public License has no legal validity in Germany. \n\nIt&#39;s worth noting that VSI is a lobby group for closed source \nsoftware vendors and that any report from this camp is likely to be \ncritical of open source. \n\nHowever, Spindler, a well-known authority on legal issues concerning \ne-commerce, the Internet, and telecommunication, and vice chairman of \nthe German Society of Law and Information Science, claims no \nassociation with VSI in the way of past or present employment or \nsponsorship. \n\nHis study, &quot;Rechtsfragen der Open Source Software,&quot; is currently \navailable in German at: \nhttp://www.vsi.de/inhalte/aktuell/studie_final_safe.pdf. Spindler can \nbe reached at: lehrstuhl.spindler@...-goettingen.de \n\n--------------------------------------------\n\nIDGNS: Your study has raised some eyebrows in the open source \ncommunity. Why so?\n\nSpindler: Regarding such legal principles as liability and warranty, \nthe GPL clauses have absolutely no legal validity. Under the license, \ndevelopers and distributors of open software are not liable for any \nproblems with their products. The GPL avoids any wording that could \nimply liability. Such a license is simply unenforceable under German, \nor even European Union law for that matter. \n\nIDGNS: Your study points to potential risks facing a number of groups \ninvolved in the open source value chain: developers, software \ncompanies and users. So, really, just about everyone who comes into \ncontact with open source software in one way or other should be \ncareful, right? \n\nSpindler: Not everyone -- for instance, users who don&#39;t modify the \nsoftware or distribute it. However, in the software developer \ncommunity, liability is an unresolved issue. Consider developers \nworking on a program from different countries. The legal question is: \nWhat sort of company is this? Is each participant liable or the group \nas a whole? Or consider a project in which one developer starts \nwriting code and then hands over that code to another who continues \nwriting and hands over to yet another. In this successive approach to \ncode writing, is the author responsible only for the code he or she \nwrote or for all code in the final software product? The answer may \ndiffer in each jurisdiction. \n\nIDGNS: And what about software companies developing products based on \nopen source code?\n\nSpindler: This is also unresolved. If, for instance, a company uses \nopen source code to develop a product of its own, there is legal \nuncertainty as to what extent the GPL covers the new product. The \nseparation of software that relies on open source code from software \nthat &quot;stands alone&quot; is tricky. Just think of application software, \nsuch as an office system, written for a Linux system. The office \napplication can&#39;t run without the underlying open source code \nprovided by Linux. \n\nIn addition, employers are in a tricky legal situation when their \nemployees write open source software. In effect, they are paying \npeople to write software that must be available for free, as required \nby the license. This is a latent contradiction. If you consider the \nemployee as the author, he is obliged under the GPL to offer the \nsource code for free. \n\nAll these points are unclear and highly controversial in the GPL.\n\nIDGNS: Some companies, like SuSE Linux AG, have built their entire \nbusiness model on the development, distribution and support of open \nsource software, particularly the Linux operating system. Are they at \nrisk? \n\nSpindler: SuSE and other companies dealing with open source software \nseparate the software, which they must provide for free as part of \nthe license, from the services they offer for a fee, such as the CD \ncontaining the software, user manuals, patches and hotline support. \nThere is some uncertainty in the open source community as to how much \ncompanies can charge for commercial services linked to a free \nproduct. And there is, again, a liability issue. SuSE and other open \nsource software companies say they aren&#39;t liable for any problems \nwith open source software. But why can&#39;t distributors and dealers be \nmade liable? \n\nFor example, under the European Union product liability directive, \neven the dealer may be held liable for product defects. Moreover, it \nremains an open question as to whether distributors can really split \nup the sale into a part containing the software and another part \ncontaining the CD and the support. \n\nIDGNS: As users, both the public and private sectors in Germany have \nshown substantial interest in open source. The federal government, in \nparticular, is a driving force in the country. Should these groups be \nconcerned about the risks of using a product for whom no one is \nliable? \n\nSpindler: I would certainly think so. But if governments and \nenterprises choose to ignore these risks, that&#39;s their decision. The \nlegal situation in Germany today is risky: Assuming the GPL is valid, \nusers of open source software have no one they can sue for problems \nwith the software. \n\nIDGNS: Why so much talk about liability now? Open source software has \nbeen around for a while.\n\nSpindler: Open source hasn&#39;t been discussed in the legal camp for \nlong. The debate that has unfolded over the past 18 months or so is a \nrelatively short time in the legal community. Moreover, the open \nsource license is a new concept that doesn&#39;t fit totally into \nGermany&#39;s traditional legal framework. So new approaches and \nsolutions have to be sought. \n\nIDGNS: And what are your suggestions to overcome the liability issues \nassociated with open source in Germany.\n\nSpindler: First of all, the GPL must be written in German and take \ninto account both German and EU law. This isn&#39;t the case today. \nSecond of all, and most importantly, the liability clause has to be \nreplaced or adapted. This is definitely in the interest of users, \nopen source developers and competition. \n \n* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * \n\n\nPara cancelar su suscripci�n a este grupo, env�e un mensaje de correo-e a:\ninfosociedad-unsubscribe@...\n\n \n\nSu uso de Yahoo!
