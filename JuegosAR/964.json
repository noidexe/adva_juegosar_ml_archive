The Argentinian group is impressed with the\nsuccessful ELSPA models in both these areas. \n\nMost leisure software destined for Argentina is distributed through Europe\nand ELSPA has recommended to those members whose rights are affected as a\nresult, that they allow CASDI, as a branch of ELSPA, to represent them in\nanti-piracy investigations and in bringing prosecutions. BBC Worldwide has\nbecome the first UK leisure software publisher to authorise CASDI in this\nway and others are now doing the same. \n\nELSPA is now planning a trade mission to Argentina both to assist CASDI and\nto help UK publishers break into one of the fastest growing markets in the\nSouthern Hemisphere. \n\nRoger Bennett, Director General of ELSPA said: \n\n&quot;As a result of recent modernisation of the country&#39;s telecomms system,\nArgentina has forged ahead of Brazil, Mexico and its other near neighbours,\nin terms of internet linked developments and inward investment from the US.\nIt has the highest per capita income in the region and social indicators on\na par with many European countries. It also has an established\ninfrastructure of professionals particularly in the media, advertising and\nPR. Argentina is a very sustainable economy and market for developing the\nsame kind of boom in the leisure software sector that we have seen in the UK\nand Europe. Unfortunately, software piracy is rampant, which CASDI, with\nsupport from their Government enforcement agencies, wish urgently to reduce\nas the first priority and with the help of ELSPA, we are confident that\ntogether, a structured, legitimate and successful market can be quickly\nestablished&quot;. \n\n&quot;We are pleased to assist CASDI in providing models for the Argentinian\nindustry and are actively recommending that our members should give CASDI a\nmandate to represent them in appropriate copyright and trademark\ninfringement actions. This approach has proved extremely effective in the UK\nand other countries and has helped ELSPA to establish a reputation as the\nleading agency for copyright protection amongst digital media industry\ngroups&quot;. \n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n"}}
