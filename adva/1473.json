One party of adventurers is left to make the ultimate\njsc&gt; choice. Should they fight back against overwhelming odds, or\njsc&gt; sentence humanity to a fate that may be worse than death?\n\n\n\njsc&gt; �\n\njsc&gt; Mazes of Fate spans the length and breadth of a huge,\njsc&gt; dynamic world, and tells an epic story of magic and conspiracy,\njsc&gt; with more than a hundred characters you can interact with, an\njsc&gt; hour of original music featuring thirty-five different themes,\njsc&gt; and twenty-five hours of gameplay.\n\n\n\njsc&gt; �\n\njsc&gt; You will explore dungeons, solve intricate puzzles, and go\njsc&gt; on multiple quests with a party of up to three adventurers.
