The nice\nthing about Open Source is a lot of times you get cutting edge (and even\nbetter than very expensive commercial products) products that don&#39;t cost\nyou anything and if you choose, you can have a say in or even be a part\nof their future development. Here are programs that I use regularly\n(keep in mind I&#39;m not an artist nor an audio guy) that might be helpful\nin what you&#39;re doing:\n\nOpenOffice (http://www.openoffice.org): Great fully featured office\npackage that will also read and write Microsoft office files.\n\nGIMP (http://www.gimp.org): The Gnu Image Manipulation Program is great\nas an alternative to Photoshop and it will read and write Photoshop\nfiles. They do have an animation module but I haven&#39;t tried it yet.\n\nAudacity (http://audacity.sourceforge.net): This is a great program for\nworking with audio files. It&#39;s served all my recording needs.\n\nMiranda Instant Messenger (http://www.miranda-im.org): Nice instant\nmessenger that supports AIM, MSN, Yahoo, ICQ, IRC, Jabber, Gadu-Gadu,\nwith e-mail notifications for those and Gmail. Not sure if that is of\nuse to your kids though.  :)\n\nWell, lots more Open Source that I use (including a bunch for software\ndevelopment) and even more that is available. You can check out the site\nfor Software Freedom Day and see some links there to things like OpenCD\nwhich is a whole CD of opensource applications.\n(http://softwarefreedomday.org/index.html)\n\nAs for a Java Script tutorial, you can find great tutorials for about\nevery language there is through a google search. I&#39;ve learned a few\nlanguages that way myself. This one looks okay:\nhttp://www.pageresource.com/jscript/\n\nHope that helps.\n\n===\n\n"}}
