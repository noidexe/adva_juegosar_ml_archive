The nice\n&gt;thing about Open Source is a lot of times you get cutting edge (and even\n&gt;better than very expensive commercial products) products that don&#39;t cost\n&gt;you anything and if you choose, you can have a say in or even be a part\n&gt;of their future development. Here are programs that I use regularly\n&gt;(keep in mind I&#39;m not an artist nor an audio guy) that might be helpful\n&gt;in what you&#39;re doing:\n&gt;\n&gt;OpenOffice (http://www.openoffice.org): Great fully featured office\n&gt;package that will also read and write Microsoft office files.\n&gt;\n&gt;GIMP (http://www.gimp.org): The Gnu Image Manipulation Program is great\n&gt;as an alternative to Photoshop and it will read and write Photoshop\n&gt;files. They do have an animation module but I haven&#39;t tried it yet.\n&gt;\n&gt;Audacity (http://audacity.sourceforge.net): This is a great program for\n&gt;working with audio files. It&#39;s served all my recording needs.\n&gt;\n&gt;Miranda Instant Messenger (http://www.miranda-im.org): Nice instant\n&gt;messenger that supports AIM, MSN, Yahoo, ICQ, IRC, Jabber, Gadu-Gadu,\n&gt;with e-mail notifications for those and Gmail. Not sure if that is of\n&gt;use to your kids though.  :)\n&gt;\n&gt;Well, lots more Open Source that I use (including a bunch for software\n&gt;development) and even more that is available. You can check out the site\n&gt;for Software Freedom Day and see some links there to things like OpenCD\n&gt;which is a whole CD of opensource applications.\n&gt;(http://softwarefreedomday.org/index.html)\n&gt;\n&gt;As for a Java Script tutorial, you can find great tutorials for about\n&gt;every language there is through a google search. I&#39;ve learned a few\n&gt;languages that way myself. This one looks okay:\n&gt;http://www.pageresource.com/jscript/\n&gt;\n&gt;Hope that helps.\n&gt;\n&gt;===\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt;Enlaces de Yahoo!
