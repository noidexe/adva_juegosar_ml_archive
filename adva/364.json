Me parece muy bueno para que la gente que\nnunca trabajo en la industria sepa bien como es el tema y no se deje\nllevar por las ferraris de Carmack y los juegos en si.\n\n&quot;So, I&#39;ve been working professionally in the games industry for over\neight years now and I can tell you � we&#39;re a funny bunch of people. As\na rule we don&#39;t dress that well, geek out over &quot;unfashionable&quot; things,\nspend too much money on superfluous technological gadgets and, dare I\nsay, might look a bit funny. Every game industry veteran I know can\ntell you stories of &quot;that guy&quot; who slept in his office, never showered\nand smelled... um... Or about the tester that, after 30 hours of\ncaffeine induced productivity, purposefully downed some testing\ndepartment concoction for $50 of pooled change.\n\nWe&#39;re a young industry. Nobody wants to make anything second rate so\nwe inevitably take on wildly ambitious projects. We also have some\ngenetic inability to schedule accurately and therefore end up working\nmassive unpaid (since most of us are salaried) overtime. Some people\nthat went to business school take advantage of this and turn game\nindustry workers into slave labor. And don&#39;t think I&#39;m just talking\nabout EA. Your industry heroes work like dogs too. Ask a Blizzard\nemployee what their &quot;core&quot; hours were for the last year+ before WoW\nlaunched. Or a Bungie employee leading up to Halo shipping. And those\nare the lucky ones. For every studio that turned out a brilliant game,\nmultiple other teams of equally cool people ended up wasting years of\ntheir lives working on games that never saw the light of day, came out\nstillborn or got pushed out early and died an ignominious screaming\nbug-filled death.\n\nDon&#39;t even get me started on the core work hours for Japanese studios.\n\nWe&#39;re young and we&#39;re stupid and we work too much. But now some of us\nare getting older and a bit smarter. We try to plan our schedules\nbetter so as not to alienate our families. But there are a lot of\npeople that want to work in the games industry � so if you won&#39;t do\nit, someone else might.\n\nSo we try to schedule better AND put out quality stuff.\n\nThe average price of making games has been escalating rapidly. Too\nmany features have become standard (multi player, obligatory tools for\nplayer made content, matchmaking, cut-scenes, transforming donkeys,\netc.), the caliber of graphics has risen (ironically, teams are\ngetting bigger AND games are getting shorter because of how long it\ntakes to make the higher quality art) and a myriad of other market\nfactors. Nothing you buy from a store was made by a few people in a\ngarage anymore. It hasn&#39;t been for years. One of my buddies was\nspeaking to a high school class a few weeks ago about the game\nindustry. After a few moments of disconnect, she asked the class what\nthey thought the development cost of the last GTA game was. Most\nstudents thought it was around $500,000. She informed them that they\nwere short about two zeros.\n\nAnd some of these games make a ton of money. Most of them don&#39;t. And\nfor the hell we go through, most of the industry doesn&#39;t pay that\nwell. There are exceptions � some people make out very well. But let\nme warn you in advance � most of us don&#39;t exactly drive Ferraris.\nDon&#39;t get into video games for the money. Do it because you love\ngames. If you want to make money in the industry, own the company.\nCreate a good new IP (intellectual property) that appears in a single\nwell received game. Then sell your company (and the IP) to a bigger\ncompany (like EA). Then leave. Don&#39;t stay � it will break your heart.\n\nOr better yet, be a publisher.\n\nI&#39;m a lead game designer. And no, I don&#39;t play games all day. I play\ngames at home in the evenings, trying not to piss off my wife because\nI&#39;m spending time with my mistress (i.e. my computer) and not her.\nWatching me work is boring. I&#39;m either writing something in Word,\njuggling columns and mathematical formulas in Excel or mocking up\nexciting diagrams in Visio. If I get really crazy, I might Photoshop\nsomething up to show an artist what I&#39;m talking about. The &quot;lead&quot; part\nof my title means that I get to spend about 25%-50% of my day\nreviewing my team&#39;s documents and scheduling tasks so that we don&#39;t\nhold up the other departments. Then I sit in hours of meetings to make\nsure that everyone understands the design� and to learn why the\nprogrammers, artists, testers, producers and even other designers want\nto string-up me up this week. If I&#39;m lucky, I have time to walk across\nthe street and get a mocha.\n\nAt PAX this year I was a judge for their &quot;pitch your idea for a game&quot;\nsit-in. I got to break a lot of hearts by telling the audience a very\nsad fact � that in my 8+ years as a professional game designer, not\nonce has any boss of mine ever asked me for an idea for a new game.\nNot once. Again, unless you own the company, you get assigned a\nproject (or jump ship to another company working on a game that sounds\ninteresting). Sure, I&#39;ve helped flesh out any number of games from\nconcept to fully realized design. And that&#39;s the hard part. Coming up\nwith a good idea for a game is like coming up with a good idea for a\nnovel. Everybody does that. But very few people have the discipline to\nsit down and write the book. The ideas are easy � the execution of the\nidea is the hard part.\n\nThe burnout factor is high. Like writing a book, there are a lot of\npeople that half way though a project throw up their hands, burn their\ncomputer, shave their dog and trek off to outer Siberia to live the\nrest of their lives as hermits.\n\nSo, to summarize, we&#39;re a young industry full of pale, egotistical\npeople that dream up ambitious games, work impossible hours and\nsometimes smell a bit funny.\n\nGod do I love it.&quot;\n\nPablo Zurita.\n\n\n\nEnlaces de Yahoo!
